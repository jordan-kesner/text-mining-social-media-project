Conservatives rejoice over 'jaw dropping' Meta censorship announcement: 'Huge win for free speech',No date found,"Constitutional law attorney Jonathan Turley provides analysis of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerbergs announcement, where he highlighted a focus on free speech and admitted the Biden administration pressured the company into censorship.
Conservatives on social media took a victory lap on Tuesday in response to the news that Meta had ended its controversial fact-checking practices and promised to move toward a system more focused onfree speech.
""Meta finally admits to censoring speech…what a great birthday present to wake up to and a huge win for free speech,"" GOP Sen. Rand Paul posted on X on Tuesday in response to news,first reportedby Fox News Digital, that Meta is ending its fact-checking program and lifting restrictions on speech to ""restore free expression"" across Facebook, Instagram and Meta platforms, admitting its current content moderation practices have ""gone too far.""
""Jaw dropping—he explicitly says Meta will ‘adopt a system like X has of community notes’ because of the bias/abuse of 3rd party fact checkers,"" Independent Women's Forum visiting fellow Lyndsey Fifieldposted on Xin response to Meta’s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, speaking to Fox News Channel’s ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning for an exclusive interview to discuss the changes.

""Nature is healing,"" Fifield said.
""There is absolutely 0 chance this would have happened if Trump didn’t win,"" Abigail Jackson, communications director for GOP Sen. Josh Hawley,posted on X.
""Here is the full video from Mark Zuckerberg announcing the end of censorship and misinformation policies,"" Breaking Points co-host Sagaar Enjetiposted on X.""I highly recommend you watch all of it as tonally it is one of the biggest indications of ‘elections have consequences’ I have ever seen.""
""Zuck is committed to cleaning house,"" journalist Jordan Schachtelposted on X.""Question the motives or not, this is a very real commitment and it's good news for speech on the internet. Of course, probably not possible to pull off without Trump winning.""
Meta’s third-party fact-checking program was put in place after the 2016 election and had been used to ""manage content"" and misinformation on its platforms, largely due to ""political pressure,"" executives said, but admitted the system has ""gone too far.""
Since then, the process has drawn the ire of conservatives who have accused the platform of politically driven censoring while pointing to several examples of content being silenced, including the bombshell New York Post reporting on Hunter Biden’s laptop, whichZuckerberg admittedthe Biden White House pressured him to do and later called the move a mistake.

Kaplan said Meta currently uses automated systems, which he said make ""too many mistakes"" and removes content ""that doesn’t even violate our standards."" He also said there are certain things Meta will continue to moderate, like posts relating to terrorism, illegal drugs and child sexual exploitation.
Zuckerberg also pointed out in his video message on Tuesday that moderation teams will be moving from California to Texas, where he suggested there will be ""less concern about the bias of our teams.""

"As Dave Chappelle fights cancel culture, 3 comedians say free speech will prevail over censorship",No date found,"
Three comics separately said freedom of speech will prevail over a small, but vocal group of cancel culture warriors aiming to censor comedians.
""Comedians just need to stop buying into all the noise, and they need to just start telling jokes how they want,"" Tyler Fischer, a New York stand-up comic, told Fox News. ""You're never going to develop as an artist unless you cross the line.""
Comedians, like Dave Chappelle, have been high-profiletargets of cancel culturein recent years. Most recently, Minneapolis' First Avenue canceled Chappelle's sold out show hours before his set time after the storied venue faced backlash from its staff and community over the superstar comedian's jokes about the transgender community.
""Too often, too much credit is given to the way people interpret what you're saying or what you're doing as a comedian rather than what your real intentions are,"" Josh Denny, a Los Angeles comedian, told Fox News.

""When venues like First Avenue cave to the mob, that's what's dangerous,"" Denny continued. ""That basically tells all those transgender people that what they think Dave Chappelle saying about them is true, and that's not the case at all.""
The comedians told Fox News they believed the people aiming to censor comedians represented a small, but over-pronounced portion of America.
""We've just inflamed the very small minority of people who are sensitive and giving them superpowers,"" Fischer said. ""I don't think America has gotten too sensitive.""
Denny similarly said: ""The people that want to censor comedy or cancel comedians who are being edgy, taking risks, pushing the envelope, I think they're a very, very organized, vocal minority of people. There really is a clamoring and I think a resurgence of audiences that just don't want politically correct comedy anymore.""
Chrissie Mayr, a New York stand-up comic, told Fox News thatcensoring comedians is""the most selfish thing you can do.""
""It's like 'Oh, I don't like this comedian … Not only do I not want to see them, but I want to make sure nobody else can see them,'"" she said.

Yet comedians have altered their jokes to align with shifting societal norms throughout history, Kliph Nesteroff, a comedy historian, has written.
""The tug of war between censorship and free speech has been part of comedy for its entire existence,"" Nesteroff wrote ina Los Angeles Times op-ed. ""It is likely to continue.""
He provided examples of 20th century comedians getting arrested or banned for their jokes.
Still, Fischer said modern cancel culture censored his own comedy for nearly a decade out of fear.
""I've been terrified to kind of step outside of that, you know, woke bubble,"" he said.
Over 80% of adults surveyed in aNew York Times/Siena College pollin February said they felt it was a serious problem that some Americans wouldn't practice their freedom of speech out of fear of retaliation or harsh criticism. An April Morning Consult poll found that roughly one-third of adults felt theycouldn't speak freely on social media.

Fischer also told Fox News he saw a shift once he began making of President Biden's age and low energy.
""I'd make fun of Donald Trump for four years,"" he said while impersonating the former president. ""Then, I made fun of Biden, and they're like, oh, you're far-right.""
NEWSWEEK COLUMN CALLS CHAPPELLE STAND-UP SHOW CANCELLATION ‘A VICTORY FOR CONFORMITY’
""I make fun of who is in power,"" Fischer continued. ""The left has gone so far that now anything sort of nuanced, in the middle, non-censored is considered far-right.""
The Media Research center identified more than 600 instances ofsocial media users facing bans, restrictions or deleted content over posts criticizing Biden between March 2020 and March 2022. The Morning Consult poll found that half of Republicans didn't feel they could speak freely on social media compared to less than 20% of Democrats.
""We have almost this religious crusade now with the political sides over who is right and who is wrong,"" Denny, who has performed stand-up for 17 years, told Fox News.
Chrissie Mayr, a New York comedian, says making fun of everyone is ""true equality."" (Fox News Digital)
""Everyone has some line, some sacred cow, that they believe is not okay to make fun of,"" Denny continued. ""And that could be their politics, it could be their religious beliefs, could be any of those things.""
Denny, Fischer and Mayr argued that protecting some groups can actually lead to more exclusion in comedy.

""True equality through comedy is everyone gets made fun of,"" Mayr told Fox News.

Chappelle has repeatedly faced criticismover his jokes about the transgender community. His Netflix special, ""The Closer,"" led to the tech giant's staff walking out in protest, though CEO Ted Sarandos defended the decision to provide Chappelle with a platform.
""Comedy is like the most inclusive thing,"" Fischer told Fox News. ""You can't slowly start cutting out topics and people that you can't joke about.""
Denny said: ""I will either make fans or not based on the kind of content I do, but I'd rather take the tortoise race to the finish of making the kind of fans I want than just doing what's easy to appease people.""

Biden agency 'likely' violated free speech by working with Big Tech to censor election content: court,No date found,"Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey reacts to the White House asking a federal appeals court to block its social media ban ruling on ‘America Reports.’
A federal court ordered an injunction on a top agency within the Department of Homeland Security after finding that it likely violated the First Amendment bycoordinating with social mediacompanies to effectively censor ""election-related speech.""
On Tuesday, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals extended the scope of an injunction in place that limits the Biden administration's communication with big tech companies to include the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security.
According to GOP Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who is leading the litigation against the Biden administration, CISA is the ""nerve center"" of the White House's ""vast censorship enterprise"" and ""the very entity that worked with the FBI to silence theHunter Biden laptop story.""
""CISA was created to protect Americans from foreign attack, and now it has begun targeting its own citizens,"" Bailey told Fox News Digital.

A three-judge panel determined in the court order that CISA was the ""primary facilitator"" of theFBI’s interactionswith the social media platforms and worked in close coordination with the FBI to push the platforms to change their moderation policies to cover ""hack-and-leak"" content.
The opinion describes CISA’s ""switchboarding"" operations as ""merely relaying flagged social-media posts from state and local election officials to the platforms."" But the judge said that ""in reality, the practice is ended up being ""[s]omething more,'"" the order reads.
""CISA used its frequent interactions with social-media platforms to push them to adopt more restrictive policies on censoring election-related speech. And CISA officials affirmatively told the platforms whether the content they had ‘switchboarded’ was true or false,"" it continues.
JUDGE PRAISED FOR 'STUNNING' JULY 4 REBUKE OF BIDEN ADMIN ON BIG TECH CENSORSHIP: 'FINALLY'

""Thus, when the platforms acted to censor CISA-switchboarded content, they did not do so independently. Rather, the platforms’ censorship decisions were made under policies that CISA has pressured them into adopting and based on CISA’s determination of the veracity of the flagged information. Thus, CISA likely significantly encouraged the platforms’ content-moderation decisions and thereby violated the First Amendment,"" the judges said.

The injunction stems from a lawsuit brought by Missouri and Louisiana attorneys general against the Biden administration that accused high-ranking government officials of working with giant social media companies ""under the guise of combating misinformation"" that ultimately led to censoring speech on topics, including Hunter Biden’s laptop, COVID-19 origins and the efficacy of face masks.

The attorneys general deposed several officials, includingDr. Anthony Fauciand FBI Special Agent Elvis Chan. On July 4, federal Judge Terry A. Doughty of the Fifth Circuit ordered the first injunction, which prevents White House officials and federal agencies from meeting with tech companies about social media censorship, arguing that such actions likely violated the First Amendment.
The scathing Independence Day injunction said the government's actionsduring the pandemicwere akin to ""an Orwellian ‘Ministry of Truth.'""

""If the allegations made by Plaintiffs are true, the present case arguably involves the most massive attack against free speech in United States’ history,"" the injunction continues. ""In their attempts to suppress alleged disinformation, the Federal Government, and particularly the Defendants named here, are alleged to have blatantly ignored the First Amendment’s right to free speech.""
The Justice Department has appealed the court order tothe Supreme Court, arguing that the government faced ""irreparable harm"" because Doughty's order may prevent the federal government from ""working with social media companies on initiatives to prevent grave harm to the American people and our democratic processes.""

Free-speech advocates push Elon Musk to fight 'state-sponsored censorship': petition,No date found,"X CEO Elon Musk said he decided to buy the social media platform because he feared the far-left views that have led to disarray in San Francisco would be infiltrated throughout the country.
In an openletter to Elon Musk, more than 50 human rights groups, journalists, commentators and think tanks asked the owner of X, formerly Twitter, to ""harness"" the social media platform to combat ""threats to free expression often come at the hands of businesses treating employees unfairly for sharing their views.
In an Aug. 5, 2023, X post,Musk announced, ""If you were unfairly treated by your employer due to posting or liking something on this platform, we will fund your legal bill. No limit.""
""Even more insidious is the mounting trend of government suppression of speech with the imposition of serious penalties, and even criminal sanctions, for free expression,"" the letter says.
""For a truly comprehensive response tofree speech restrictions, our request is that you extend this important offer to cases of state-driven censorship,"" the signatories wrote.

""Free speech is broadly protected by every major human rights treaty; however, in the West, speech increasingly is targeted by ‘hate speech’ laws. In other regions, blasphemy laws target minority groups, sometimes with the sentence of death. These repressive laws are two sides of the same coin – both punish those who speak out against state-approved views,"" the letter states.
Highlighted within the letter are three active cases involving individuals who have been punished by their respective governments for their speech with which the government disagrees.
In Finland, a parliamentarian and former government minister is currently awaiting a verdict after having been criminally tried for ""hate speech"" for a 2019 Bible-verse tweet. She was charged under the Finnish criminal code’s section on ""War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity,"" carrying a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment.

Aruling in her caseis expected at the end of this month.
In Mexico, former congressman Rodrigo Iván Cortés and sitting congressman Gabriel Quadri have been convicted of ""gender-based political violence"" and placed on an offenders’ register for X posts. For expressing their views on biological sex, both have been ordered to publish acourt-written apology on Xevery day for 30 days, three times a day, as a form of public humiliation.
At theinternational level, the European Commission is advancing efforts to make ""hate speech"" an EU crime, on the same legal level as trafficking and terrorism. Initiatives such as the EU Code of Practice on Disinformation could have significant implications for how governments police speech, especially as European Commission VP Věra Jourová singled out X for ""the largest ratio of mis/disinformation posts"" in her Sept. 26, 2023, statement.
""Given your commitment to free speech and unrivaled capacity to effect change, we ask that you harness X to make clear that no one should be punished under the law for peaceful expression on X or any platform,"" the letter says.

"Alex Berenson on 'censorship', free speech: 'Times have changed and the NY Times has changed'",No date found,"Former New York Times reporter speaks out, remarks how conservative movement welcomes freedom of thought
Former New York Times reporterAlex Berensonslammed the mainstreammediaand Big Tech for its continued attempts to censor and ""deplatform"" views it does not like or does not want to debate, during his speech at theConservative Political Action Conferencein Orlando, Fla.
Berenson joked with the crowd that his otherwise liberal politics wouldn't often land him at the nation's premier conservative activist event.
""I'm honestly surprised as any of you that I'm here -- if you knew my voting record you'd think I should be speaking at the ACLU, not CPAC,"" he said at the conference, which isstreaming live on Fox Nation.
""Times have changed and the New York Times, where I used to work, has changed.""
TRUMP, AT CPAC, EXPECTED TO HAMMER BIDEN ON IMMIGRATION, CHINA
Berenson said that he and other classical liberals have not changed their views on freedom of expression or open public discourse:
""It's not me, it's the Times,"" he said adding that columnists at liberal mainstream papers like the Grey Lady have pivoted to routinely call for censorship of their political opponents.
""I never would've imagined being on Fox, while the Times either ignored me or tried to bash me.""
Berenson made clear the threat of censorship from powerful entities comes both from public and private concerns: the government, Big Tech and media.
The pro-censorship crowd is frustrated, he said, because they are recognizing their inability to control public narratives as easily as they want, given the diaspora of media and technology in recent years.
""75 million people voted for Donald Trump, and they think that's a cataclysm,"" he added.
Berenson went on to describe more of his own experiences with censorship, claiming that Amazon initially refused to market his recent book -- which expresses a narrative on coronavirus and lockdowns that runs counter to conventional media and Big Tech thought -- until entrepreneur Elon Musk spoke out against it, and the Jeff Bezos-helmed firmlater relented.
ALEX BERENSON'S CORONAVIRUS BOOKLET HITS TOP SPOT ON AMAZON AFTER ONLINE RETAILER INITIALLY REJECTED IT
""This censorship is still happening -- a lot of people still can't get their stuff published on Amazon.""
He added that Amazon's power is compounded by the fact it and other tech firms like it have been allowed to control most of the business in their particular fields.
""Squeezing the flow of information is extraordinarily dangerous for big companies to do this because they're quasi-monopolies.
""When ideology and profit are running the same way, it's almost impossible for people to reconsider their actions or consider the consequences of their actions,"" he added.
Berenson remarked that his CPAC badge lists him as a ""self-employed"" journalist, adding that being ""self-employed"" is now the only way for reporters to ultimately guarantee they won't be fired or discriminated against in the workplace for personal views.
""I'm stunned I've fallen in with the conservative movement,"" he added.

""You're more committed to freedom of thought and speech and debate than anyone else and you should be proud of that.""
Berenson said it is important for people of any political stripe, who believe in the constitutional protections in the First Amendment, not to be afraid to go to unfamiliar territory to exercise those rights.
""It is sad that people who think they know best will not talk to you or debate to you.""

JONATHAN TURLEY: Meta's Zuckerberg makes a free speech move that could be truly transformational,No date found,"Constitutional law attorney Jonathan Turley provides analysis of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's announcement, where he highlighted a focus on free speech and admitted the Biden administration pressured the company into censorship.
""Faithful friends are hard to find."" For the free speech community, those words from Shakespeare have long been tragically true. Indeed, until tech billionaireElon Muskbought Twitter (now X), we were losing ground around the world to an unprecedented anti-free speech coalition of government, corporate, media, and academic interests.
Now, Musk may have added a major new ally that could help turn the tide for free speech: Mark Zuckerberg.
In a new video,Meta's CEOannounced that the company would adopt X standards and restore free speech protections across Facebook, Instagram, and Meta platforms. Meta will also end its third-party fact-checking program, introduce a 'community notes' system, and focus on removing criminal and fraudulent material—the very guidelinesproposed by some of usin prior years.
META ENDS FACT-CHECKING PROGRAM AS ZUCKERBERG VOWS TO RESTORE FREE EXPRESSION ON FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM
For the free speech community, it was like the United States entering World War II to support Great Britain. Where Musk stopped the progress of the global anti-free speech movement, Zuckerberg could actually help us regain ground around the world.
As one of Zuckerberg's most vocal critics over free speech, it is admittedly hard to trust the Meta CEO. We all love redemptive sinners, but it would be more impressive if the redemption preceded the apprehension.

So, allow me a brief cathartic moment...
In the last few years, a mix of House investigations and litigation has forced more of the censorship system under the Biden administration into public view. That is expected to draw even greater attention with the continued discovery in Missouri v. Biden,showing years of false statements about the extent of this government-corporate alliance across social media platforms.
CONSERVATIVES REJOICE OVER 'JAW DROPPING' META CENSORSHIP ANNOUNCEMENT: 'HUGE WIN FOR FREE SPEECH'
In my recent book, ""The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage,"" I wrote about Zuckerburg and Meta's record on censorship, including their failure (until recently) to release the Facebook files.
Meta resisted efforts to uncover this evidence for years, even after Musk releasedthe Twitter Filesand revealed a censorship system described by one court as perfectly ""Orwellian.""
While Zuckerburg portrayed Meta as an unwilling partner in this censorship system in his Tuesday video, he and the company ignored several years of objections from many of us regarding the critical role the company plays in targeting and censoring opposing viewpoints.
Facebook evenran a creepy ad campaignto try to convince young people to embrace what they call ""content modification"" as part of their evolution with technology. It did not work.
While Zuckerburg portrayed Meta as an unwilling partner in this censorship system in his Tuesday video, he and the company ignored several years of objections from many of us regarding the critical role the company plays in targeting and censoring opposing viewpoints.
When the anti-free speech movement targeted Musk, Zuckerberg did nothing for years. Fearing that other companies might restore free speech protections, members of Congress, including now Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., sent a chilling letter to Facebook stating that it should not even consider such a move or risk becoming ""part of our ongoing oversight efforts.""
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
In a November 2020 Senate hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., warned Zuckerberg and other CEOs that he and hisSenate colleagueswould not tolerate any ""backsliding or retrenching"" by ""failing to take action against dangerous disinformation.""
While Musk defied those threats, the pressure seemed to work with Zuckerberg. It was not until the Republicans won both houses and the White House that Zuckerberg and Meta decided that free speech was worth fighting for.
In his exclusive interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, admitted that the Trump election changed the situation for the technology company: ""We have a new administration coming in that is far from pressuring companies to censor and [is more] a huge supporter of free expression.""

It is a chilling statement if one thinks of what might have happened ifKamala Harrisand Tim Walz, arguably the most anti-free speech ticket in history, had won. The suggestion is that the new spring at Meta would have turned into a frozen tundra for free speech.
Around the world, free speech is in a free fall. Speech crimes and censorship have become the norm in the West. A new industry of ""disinformation"" experts has commoditized censorship, making millions in the targeting and silencing of others. An anti-free speech culture has taken root in government, higher education, and the media.
We will either hold the line now or lose this indispensable right for future generations. Zuckerberg could make this a truly transformative moment but it will take more than a passing meta-culpa.

We need Zuckerberg now more than ever.
So, with that off my chest, I can get to what I have longed to say: Mr. Zuckerberg, welcome to the fight.
