Donald Trump has been officially sworn in as the 47th president of the US. Although we’ve already experienced a Trump presidency beginning in 2016, this term could look far different than the first one, particularly when it comes to tech regulation.

The heads of major tech companies have apparently come to learn how to deal with Trump, following an era of techlash that invited fury against them from both sides. The executives — who mostly stayed at arm’s distance during the beginning of Trump’s first term — have been quick to get into Trump’s good graces, be it with trips to Mar-a-Lago, attendance at the inauguration, changes to their company policies, or notices to millions of users thanking Trump for his (predicted) role in getting their popular social media app back online.

There’s good reason for the CEOs to cozy up to Trump. The next four years could see the president’s choices impact their companies and workers in a laundry list of areas. We’ll be looking at:

Trump has said he’ll use his first afternoon back in the Oval Office to sign “dozens of executive orders.” They’re expected to cover border policy, the environment, trade, and possibly even a delay to the TikTok ban. If it’s anything like the first term, we’ll see many of those challenged in court — and the results will indicate just how much of a check Trump will have on his power this time around.
