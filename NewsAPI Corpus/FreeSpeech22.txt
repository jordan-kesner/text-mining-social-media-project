Elon Musk's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience in November 2024 offered a mix of open discussions, fascinating anecdotes and bold claims. The two-hour conversation touched on everything from Musk's gaming skills to his dietary preferences. Still, one of the biggest takeaways was Rogan's heartfelt praise for Musk's controversial purchase of Twitter, now rebranded as X.

Rogan declared Musk's acquisition pivotal in preserving free speech: “Thank you so much for buying Twitter. Thank you so much. I'm not exaggerating when I think you changed the course of history."

Overpriced But Vital?

Musk admitted that buying Twitter for $44 billion in 2022 was "way overpriced," but he felt it was necessary to stop growing censorship and control over what people can say online. Rogan agreed, criticizing the suppression of information on social media platforms before Musk's involvement. Specifically, they discussed Twitter's role in controversial events like the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story and the censorship of dissenting voices during the pandemic.

"If you didn't do it, no one else would have," Rogan said. "I keep hearing from idiots: ‘Elon’s a bad business owner. Twitter is worth 400% less than when he bought it.’ No it wasn’t worth that in the first place. It wasn’t worth $44 billion, you morons.”

Musk's rationale for purchasing Twitter stemmed from his observations as the platform's most interacted-with user. He claimed he could detect algorithmic changes and censorship efforts, which made him uneasy. Rogan called Musk's actions a "fork in the road," preventing governments and corporations from monopolizing control over digital discourse.
