On January 20, 2025, the world watched as Donald Trump was sworn in—again—as the 47th President of the United States. But this wasn’t just any inauguration. This wasn’t just about the transfer of power.

This was about who holds the keys to the internet itself.

Because standing in the VIP section, watching with keen interest, were the most powerful figures in media and technology:

Rupert Murdoch , the ultimate kingmaker of conservative media.

, the ultimate kingmaker of conservative media. Elon Musk , the owner of X (formerly Twitter), Trump’s old battlefield for unfiltered speech.

, the owner of X (formerly Twitter), Trump’s old battlefield for unfiltered speech. The CEOs of Apple, Google, and Meta (Facebook/Instagram/threads) —the architects of our digital world.

What were they doing there? And more importantly, what does this mean for the future of free speech, media, and the internet?

Trump’s Information Power Play

For years, Trump has railed against Big Tech censorship, accusing platforms of silencing conservative voices. He even launched his own platform, Truth Social, to fight back.

But now, the game has changed.

This wasn’t a room full of enemies. This was a meeting of the new elite—the people who decide what you see, what you read, and what you believe.

If Trump was once at war with these tech moguls, why are they now standing by his side?

Is this a surrender from Big Tech , or something more sinister?

, or something more sinister? Are we witnessing the birth of an unholy alliance between politics, AI, and social media?

The End of Digital Free Speech?

With Trump in power and the biggest players in tech seemingly aligned with him, we’re entering a new era.

What happens to free speech when politics and tech power become one?

Who controls the algorithms that decide what content goes viral—and what gets buried?

What if the platforms that once censored Trump now start silencing his opposition?

Elon Musk’s presence is particularly fascinating. As the owner of X (formerly Twitter), he has positioned himself as a free speech absolutist—but will that apply equally in a Trump-controlled world?

And then there’s AI. With OpenAI’s leadership in attendance, it’s impossible to ignore the role artificial intelligence will play in shaping online discourse. Could AI tools like ChatGPT become politically influenced? Will fact-checking be biased?

A Digital Coup? How Information Will Be Controlled

If the 2016 election was shaped by Facebook, Twitter, and Russian bots, and 2020 was fought over mail-in ballots and voter suppression, 2025 is shaping up to be a battle for total information dominance.

Key risks of this new Trump-Tech alignment:

Algorithmic Favoritism – What if pro-Trump content is pushed while dissenting views are quietly suppressed? The average user would never even know.

AI-Generated Political Messaging – Imagine ChatGPT shaping responses to political questions in a way that subtly favors one ideology over another. AI can control narratives in ways we don’t yet fully understand.

Musk’s ‘Free Speech’ Paradox – If Elon Musk’s X becomes Trump’s new megaphone, what happens to opposition voices?

China and TikTok – Trump once called TikTok a national security threat. Now, its leadership was at his inauguration. Did a backroom deal happen?

Amazon’s Cloud Control – With AWS (Amazon Web Services) powering much of the internet, could web hosting be used as a political weapon?

Trump’s Digital Takeover: A Masterstroke or a Threat to Democracy?

Let’s be clear—Trump doesn’t just want to be President. He wants to control the conversation.

By aligning himself with the digital gatekeepers of the modern world, he ensures that the internet itself bends to his narrative.

If he controls the legacy media (Murdoch) , he controls TV news .

, he controls . If he controls the social media platforms , he controls the public discourse .

, he controls . If he controls AI, he controls what people believe is true.

This is no longer about Trump vs. The Media.

This is Trump becoming The Media.

What Happens Next?

Expect policy changes that reshape tech regulations—but in ways that benefit the companies standing by Trump’s side.

Expect a crackdown on certain types of speech—not just from the left, but possibly even from Trump’s own critics.

Expect AI and social media to play a bigger role than ever before in shaping public opinion—but in ways we may never fully see or understand.

The internet was once seen as the great equalizer, a space for free expression. But what happens when the people who control the platforms and the people who control the government become the same people?

If 2016 and 2020 taught us anything, it’s that who controls the media controls the election.

And in 2025, Trump may have just secured the biggest media empire in history.

Are we witnessing a new era of free speech and digital democracy—or the most sophisticated attempt yet to control public perception?

And more importantly, will you even be able to tell the difference?
