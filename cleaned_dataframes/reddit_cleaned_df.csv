nothing wrong probably accurate description understand libertarianism political ideology philosophical idea directly concerned libertarian party libertarian party really ideologically cohesive group way republican democratic parties libertarianism capital design ideologically broad based small set axioms taken seriously analyzing particular issue consequently diverse applications lead diverse contrast example progressive ideology extremely narrow specific stances important issues baked ideology distribution wealth particular approved models distribution wealth narrowness design ideologies

ensuring behavior personal political ethical infringe rights sometimes hear distinction explained libertarian adjective noun quite little bit basic ideological principle something harm interfere choices libertarian party applying principle government policy particular aware unintended consequences real costs policies terms harm understand believe almost government involvement economics including regulation taxation subsidizing tariffs etc negative impact economy yes important note assumption conclusion based literally centuries political philosophy first questions libertarian think businesses able survive long term without preventing monopolies larger already established businesses squishing competition economics point view bad thing monopoly causes inefficient use resources inefficiency shows market prices much higher competition important media claims company monopoly keeping prices artificially low full crap however high prices caused monopoly invite competition monopoly making longer monopoly consequently practice actual monopolies tend exist long occur market develops examples monopolies exist long periods time monopolies either explicitly government legislation implicitly creating legislation makes difficult compete local laws discourage google fiber moving city basic economic facts political philosophy libertarian political philosophy comes play noticing laws intended protect consumers often accidentally create monopolies harm seems view monopolies exist without large presence government already hard time believing company unable gain control industry left field economics disagrees real life empirical fact actual monopolies extremely libertarians think welfare programs negative impact general populace programs designed take advantage expected able survive libertarian economy truly libertarian economy free enough demand jobs larger supply jobs consequently vast majority able find sufficiently highly paid jobs need extreme examples true example someone serious disease prevents working case libertarian solution private charities run much efficiently government megaprograms provide personalized help way faceless bureaucracy case

Mixed Opinions,cmv prageru allowed call university prageru american media company specializes producing propaganda american conservative ideology youtube channel million subscribers videos collectively viewed billions times year content far political center even arguably extreme far right often fails pass basic scrutiny terms factual references logical conclusions allowed use term university name edit wow okay knew controversial topic expecting kind response sake authenticity going change anything already written clear initial argument strong could made instead want provide clarification anything edit notes ish material many thanks awards stated yesterday try around giving deltas comments consider slight change perspective worth recognition including offering clarification something argument rests three key considerations word carries specific connotation respected institution dedicated advancement knowledge learning world using word title organization prager creating positive association platform officially recognized institution higher education although organization specifically states university ever claimed partly lie virtue use term words use word trying communicate specific message status platform spreading media content education rhetoric propaganda exists process higher education center given title university process organizations responsible assigning reviewing accreditation status independent beholden government specific instances theory organization establish standards certifying institution university failing meet government criteria process acceptable basis consistent independent universities certify accreditation organizations actively work meet government standards running university something business government guarantees cash flow form student loans yet certifying body fails meet criteria could still theoretically function primary role consider organizations official terms titles find simply give name without proper certification backing civilian police firefighting organizations instance likewise hospital must meet strict standards call hospital allowing opposite harms public trust institutions make harder official organizations provide service advocating restricting individual organization freedom expression speech position rather saying certain institutions deserving respect position importance society person organization label institutions without first meeting criteria established independent body composed members professional field prageru claim university offer degrees facts buried resources made front center presentation public know using title university create association public mind however small tenuous means bolster arguments help spread propaganda harms public trust actual universities value obtaining university degree deceitful misleading since prageru admits obtained accreditation allowed use word part side note believe standard apply organizations fail meet accreditation standards regardless education services provide believe establish stricter standards organizations wish add news title effort reinforce public trust journalism change view edit many excellent points brought far thank discussion obligations evening shall return review award deltas appropriate suspect deserving want make clarification statement prager making university status apparent based first exposure organization see easier recall determine fact institution taken seriously however personal experience friends family take seriously find disturbing many reasons yes mainly quoting serious discussion edit goes first anyone think prageru real university take best possible light means prager obviously real university way brazzers obviously place higher education excuse fact prager holding sort educational institute search prageru google second hit wikpedia page explains name short prager university youtube page design aesthetics coupled use word university name suggests channel belongs legitimate university provided free educational service general public prager site specifically page find prager university world leading conservative nonprofit focused changing minds creative use digital media say proper university yes understand disclaimer sorts find webpage point necessarily easy find realize many comments able find information admitted trouble admitted thinking prageru forward facing campaign legitimate university personally yes thought legit first learned though quickly discovered checking reviews content point enough world diligent taken deception second see comparisons made marxist universities leftist news organizations let try understand concerns position good faith marxism economic philosophy generally teaches product labor belong directly labored philosophy granted yes marxism least dozen philosophical branches possibly account ways marxism intersect philosophies political science sociology psychology history etc words treat comparison prager marxist universities worth exploring unless first define terms far seen definition left work know marxist universities piece rhetoric designed scare thinking going forced something bad guess worth noting question university required drop word title easily answered yes order implement standard governing body able restrict use given word narrow specific application reasonable standards place anyone meet standards could subject sanctions fines perhaps another form punishment frankly exact actions taken offender immaterial matters action allowed grant delved specifics possible action seen practical reasonable know certainty without taking time explore course ultimately advocating declaration intent society value use term specific context thus put forth effort limit abuse regarding comparison news organizations realize included original post example professional organizations probably exist groups currently perfectly comfortable independent civilian governing body defines standards journalistic work reviews work various news organizations issues sanctions reprimands orgs claim producing content fact fail meet minimum professional standards yes realize difficult implement program yes realize possibility abuse statements achieving goal statements bother goal first place third point governing body currently exists say try restrict use word university create professional civilian group responsible defining standards enforcing true specify need create body original points true consider amendment believe governing body possibly accreditation system already exists responsible assessing institution status university levying sanctions meet requirements yet insist calling pointed since civilian group already exists chosen route probably good reasons behind choice accept though curious understand reasons naturally brings two questions required remove word title prevent words adopted place instance consider hamburger university inappropriate brazzers university stated okay idea mcdonald use term although offer professional development program translate university system change program meet proper standards use title latter however falls legal status fair use parody something hammered probably fall side free speech argument since real harm involved deli local campus calling university lunch foul allowing use word brings fourth major argument change prager nothing wrong want set aside political divide really germane issue take prager organization thing prager claim possess knowledge educating without providing sufficient evidence back claims something making thin air comes looking responses prager videos prager misleads audience southern strategy prager uses specific rhetoric presentation techniques make appear legitimate believable prager lies climate change easily find searching online debunking prageru prageru response similar terms stated issue political positions prager takes present ideas information organization exact thing calling university air respectability provides simultaneously spreading misinformation disinformation lies general public yes obviously required drop university title specific harm involved promulgation misleading information interpret information subject debate conclusions draw facts hand something discuss underlying facts subject obfuscation misdirection outright lies unfortunately prager located america actually fascist state despite persons either extreme might say simply practical desirable limit freedom misinform misdirect lie fortunately nobody arguing prager allowed voice opinions conclusions based data hand arguments craft support ideas wish take away saying america treat universities deserving higher social status

electrical math concepts ban well uncommon make educational titled university understand mean going give educational content never mistakenly took content going actual university suspect hardly anyone want clarify want hold standard ban use word answer yes want government enforcement penalties look least honest say content allowed organization see giving power tell prageru change name clear

hamburger university allowed cheapens whole concept higher continuing education firstly evidence hamburger university cheapens concept higher education best could argue hamburger university cheapens

Mixed Opinions,cmv person able charged dui dwi unless actually driving college roommate went drinking night got arguement someone bar decided leave realized much drink called ride mid august super hot outside waiting ride sat truck ran police officer saw took dwi convicted effected employment schooling next couple years never liked guy much always thought got raw deal right thing got penalty decided drive home able sleep car without fear consequence heard argument officer saw drunk sitting car walked away person could start driving moment argue easy take person home take jail doesnt ruin life police could even take jail dry night sure reason suspend license fine imprison person simply sitting car keys possession even sitting running vehicle head first argument see coming apply vehicle lane traffic obviously passed stop sign something deserve dwi update reading tons comments view changed marginally believe completely legal believe form moderate traffic citation fine associated along ride home night drunk tank way police prevent tragedies making assumption person definitely going drive ruining person life dont expect replies day family spending time phone feel free discuss amongst post temporarily locked due excessive comment rule violations necessarily broken posting rules post gets another sub lead influx rule breaking comments small team moderators easily overwhelm ability

drivers seat engine running makes difficult give jury reasonable doubt driver defined state vehicle code think stronger case passenger seat backseat quite thing feel little bit someone candy bars jeans pockets convenience store maybe could using pockets carry purchases instead grocery basket think technically shoplifting leave items something hidden pants store either sounds horrible defense attorney reduced lesser charge never drove able show called ride route sure part world friend may able expunged time long commit crimes arresting officer following procedures could confirmed ride turn keys bar taken station next something arrest prosecution feel little story driver seat perhaps circumstances order show intending drive sit passenger seat back seat otherwise totally understand law enforcement erring side ticket someone may intending drive allowing drunk know may thinking correctly suddenly deciding well enough drive think reason arrest try sneaky pull pretend drining cop around great example someone claimed mate clearly always obvious heard past allowed back car long keys ignition driver seat sure exact law much vary state country sucks friend got screwed opinion main problem really law poorly communicated hear drink drive law actually drunk engine another comment able accidentally commit crime although obviously difficult achieve agree spirit drunk engine widely known probably making post friend brazenly breaking law everyone knows instead getting picked agree moving moving treated differently well circumstances prove called ride parking lot pointed many perfectly acceptable example walk around rocket launcher surprised charged say going hurt anyone matter rocket launchers banned everyone knows even owning rocket launcher sitting driver seat running car drunk thing harmless patterns behaviour decided prevent greater question still completely oppose law sitting driving seat engine turned drunk even turn car drunk something widely well understood reading thread see sitting drivers seat car running level criminality poor judgement puts risk drunk person behind wheel running parked car become drunk person behind wheel running moving car quickly opinion law changed allow spectrum perhaps achieved practice case case basis lowering charge lesser reckless driving prefer encapsulated law example operating intoxicated could lower charge operating driving intoxicated operating alone might result fine suspended license permanent record something along leaves work cops judge determine law fits given case guy sitting parking lot beside bar whose friend shows minutes later give ride home pretty obvious guy sitting side highway front end car smashed tree pretty obvious cases less clear cop sure charge correct courts similar story campus police university went visit friend weekend mid staying dorm ahole pulled fire alarm drunk sleeping happened went outside wait freezing literally shirts friend remembered heleft keys floor mat went car run heat warm cop must watching soon started car knock drivers window drinking yes going anywhere staying warm back dorm step car please arrested charged oui got dui sleeping truck party near park parked park walked back passed truck even threw keys box thought keys way issues nope cop wakes tapping window older truck roll windows manually proceeds arrest upon realizing beers smell spent night jail next months court dates fighting paying lawyer fees finally hated legal system ever since system much injured party someone still gets charged bullshit gets old real quick

initiatives help families care children many different programs different countries done maternity leave healthcare reforms centered around birth care subsidies assist childrearing cost etc usually government forms assistance intense opposition private attempts help families issues planned parenthood first thing comes mind probably good examples saying noticed conservatives support birth control

essentially forced think truly believe killing baby inside womb different murdering person street although understand someone might feel moral obligation prevent occurring someone might step prevent husband stabbing wife etc say bravely prevent wife act moral duty hook make sure wife comfortable life saved dying think necessarily think approach whole thing simply stepping prevent murder occurring believe duty protect protect wrong understand rational logical viewpoint republicans believe individual liberty empowerment belief unborn human necessitates think social programs fantastic general republican position island man responsibility life family want kids good education push want kids food shelter etc really logical inconsistency beliefs result need push social programs worldview conservative slowly crossing aisle older add making easier adopt kids need make willing parents passed tests checks pay tens thousands dollars put ringerx given guarantees often lied lot families want adopt help let give kids chance understand republicans abortion want deny rights women instead consider unborn fetus human sometimes conception therefore abortion saying must protect children every

Mixed Opinions,war conservatism hidden philosophical war brewing among conservatives decades became apparent donald trump nomination republican party presidency becoming clear side war dates back well constitution written repeated throughout history side gaining advantage first identify two sides point important good names call traditionalists classical liberals dispute accuracy names later think gets idea across traditionalists opposed change nationalists necessarily racist form extremely religious want religion part government among many identifying factors important opposed leftist ideologies opposition defining traditionalists never important traditionalists realize much opposition leftism intentionally vague defining later important point qualities definitional separate traditionalists everyone else political spectrum traditionalists many beliefs universal rights equality everyone rights free speech protest freedom press among many others important point beliefs define sure many traditionalists argue fact true entire point post classical liberals within conservative party many features traditionalists massive distinction features define classical liberals opposed change sense slow change oppose change change sake many certainly even majority religious maintain far strict separation church state clearly oppose leftism defined opposition later defines classical liberals within conservative party dedication universal negative rights everyone dedication rights free speech freedom press amendment rights many view rights principles violated constitution serves political bible deviate conservatives reading think camps wrong past lines blurred confused confused shared interest difference emphasis ideas traditionalists defined ideas believe others classical liberals conservatism defined ideas traditionalists merely believe simply believe ideas traditionalists define today current political climate lines clearly drawn drawn man president donald trump historical philosophical chops intentionally draw lines nonetheless traditionalists make vast support trump base mostly basis desire oppose left support president donald trump almost definitely traditionalist may think classical liberal reason may think classical liberal leaders conservative movement blurred lines men glenn beck rush limbaugh ted cruz mark levin ben sasse jeff sessions preached founding fathers first principles defended bill rights proclaimed constitutionalists absolutely believe things essential political identity know listened believe ideals among many others taught conservatism attended limbaugh school conservative studies listened beck attack obama increasing power executive fight universal healthcare watched ted cruz fight congress protect borders supported something strange happened donald trump announced candidacy presidency republican party watched shrug watched start panic despair trump watched something even stranger face reluctantly supported hillary clinton absolutely could win reluctant support slowly turned defense really stupid stuff thrown know really stupid stuff defense left win became support point defines traditionalists let left win essential political beliefs defines beyond beliefs universal negative rights constitution definition traditionalists draws battle lines war conservatism taken point post reading support donald trump sacrificing basic principles universal negative rights separation powers federalism states moral standards basic competence beat joe biden left begin describe many talked many read refuse allow pesky ideals principles way opposition left guessed yet conservative classical liberal utterly oppose donald trump trampling constitution oppose ineptitude powers given attempt secure powers given oppose rejection conservative principles intentional division nation immoral ethical standards say nice things matter saying thing another accepting money foreign diplomats knowledgeable direct rejection constitution directed staff refuse legal subpoena legal vote house begin impeachment inquiry unconstitutional stance absolute immunity stopped international funds designated congress signed law executive ignoring legally defined process could hurt primary political opponent instituted restriction free speech guise fairness increased division nation taunting political opponents fomenting hatred provoking partisanship every opportune moment list goes realize many conservatives reading deny obvious facts humor seconds support trump favor entertain idea facts true seconds ask think seconds stop lot needless debate even things true still support even spend next days debating veracity facts come back simple fact let joe biden win november say left ignored principles play rules say agenda take guns make abortion law land fundamental transformation towards socialist goals something absolutely happen say left win make traditionalist willing abandon principle left win war know convince switch sides want know side actually want know line fighting left fighting principle fighting constitution democratic republic values wrong side war winning war conservatism losing war nation another long post watched something even stranger face reluctantly supported hillary clinton absolutely could fall love republicans fall registered republican ideologically libertarian fall classical liberal description made sides internal war going could summed many ways think key point established attempting hold onto power youths supported ron paul bernie sanders attempting take party grow influence hope election cycles trend move away establishment towards libertarians versus progressives think conservative opposition trump well warranted lincoln project ads certainly seem persuasive might disagree even idea ideological war republicans primary americans general giant change vast majority republicans support expected never trumpers leaving party increased partisanship think continue see trump style populism right influence drastically fall power republicans return mitt romney marco rubio types maybe specifically nikki haley definitely going republican nominee really appreciate post liberal democrat illusions happen strong opposition party check worst excesses last years trump actually pushed little right concerning government power think form inevitable concerned easily institutions corrupted current chief executive want supreme power health care wielded someone corrupt competent trump lot reasons gop fell trumpism think nailed analysis negative partisanship fear party power sentiment fueled right wing media last years allows unheard level cognitive dissonance occurring left well see radicalized leftists coalesced around bernie sanders campaign dsa fed daily dose unreality proud shedding principles fairness due process fair elections outlets young turks intercept rose etc building kind structure corrupted gop right center hold country probably disagree policy issues somethings important policy country used work way opposition party least try undermine party power hash differences elections need return principles definition classic liberal lines rather heavily libertarian beliefs united states loads libertarians align republican party two party system makes true deviation two ideologies almost assures victory end political spectrum however insist making note end saying vote trump keep biden winning insinuates traditionalist disagree given today many lie firmly opposite sides spectrum acknowledge point inherently stuck two choices ideologically libertarian vote republican fiscal policy important within government feel generationally party going change many younger conservatives feel though constant social regulations undermine fundemental conservative value small government hopefully see modernization loosening social policy within republican party occur lifetime vote libertarian candidates win much make statement wasted vote vote biden may moderate oppose radical sects party yes libertarian vote trump biden wins american economic policy may never recover massive overhaul left attempt give rephrase heart argument sure understand getting point classic liberals within conservative party must vote biden else really classic liberals lot good info think positions projecting certain beliefs onto groups think way cynical answer politics recently dems gop fighting constitution major party fighting constitution case much say irrelevant say defines classical liberals within conservative party dedication universal negative rights everyone dedication rights free speech freedom press amendment rights many see democratic party aligns beliefs true love evidence contrary voting either party let alone candidates requires compromising beliefs way real question beliefs willing compromise beliefs hold firm reading support donald trump sacrificing basic principles universal negative rights separation powers federalism states moral standards basic competence beat joe biden left become pure support biden make nation better place well previous nation borders blur line bit possible support personal responsibility individual freedom limited government sanctity human life rule law choose trump biden apparently offends sense purity presidential election time binary choice yet met politician exact position every single issue must choose support important principles biden politician think many ways traditionalists feel losing war nation willing break classical liberals aware point christianity steep decline supreme court decisions gay marriage led many conservative christians feel losing control society led mentality described dubious best think ability tell others exactly political beliefs know wrong even political science post rant really interesting description experienced era trump first became candidate really thought chance precisely hold conservative principles mention end say party supported turned election spite weakness principles could let clinton win counter elections binary choice yes always vote third party candidate chance victory practically two win election rare opportunity vote candidate absolutely agree every principle ballot box vote candidate feel better two believe fair judge voter prioritized defeat opponent principles every time make practical binary choice

trying think possibilities necessarily bet money actually working plausible options come interested hear ideas pass catastrophic coverage healthcare big topic democrats want see medicare option outright nationalized healthcare republicans government control anything free markets think democrats make case emergency services follow free market principles limited choices insurance choices

ironically uniting green jobs disadvantaged areas republicans especially republicans tend win rural areas less college degrees less economic opportunity democrats explicitly intend eventually kill

appalachia rocky mountains using abandoned mines rail lines compressed air train energy storage usually much tree cover urban areas maybe install solar panels rooftops let households receive profits energy production fails republicans stance climate change skeptical best even believed something done climate change tend believe government creating jobs green jobs targeted republican areas country
