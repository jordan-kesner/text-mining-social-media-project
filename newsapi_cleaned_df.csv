restructuring economic relations world let start european union preparing respond guess tariff challenge challenges trump administration starting latest tariff steel aluminum tocci great well thank much wonderful cfr let make perhaps rather general remarks sort weave tariff bit think know europeans think second trump administration elements course resonate first steroids newer perhaps become far apparent last time around think relevant tariff story tariff story even security questions sure going obviously first element old element coming know back vengeance transaction list know see fact donald trump interested deals essentially looks tariffs instrument see kind know willingness look deals even areas right mean probably doug going talking security front especially far ukraine concerned know sense know want deal necessarily interested actually fine details deal long deal right seems kind impression economics front economics front perhaps little sort footnote especially security know think drive deal puts europeans difficult predicament almost regardless happens scenario indeed let say deal ukraine actually reached firstly presumably reached heads europeans course kind know brings sorts issues problems deal actually potentially politically divisive europe insofar presumably countries particularly north eastern europe see pretty bad deal therefore really require continuing support ukraine terms defense terms threat force mean going doug going essentially know deal fragile therefore require sort committed european response situation actually think relatively divisive europe countries willing see know peace made right therefore opportunity back terms support ukraine course scenario deal probably even plausible first scenario sort trump actually kind gets bored starts looking nobel peace prize elsewhere scenario ongoing war deal onto shoulders europeans anyway onto second aspect old know steroids indeed protectionism know know going tariffs steel aluminum quite know exactly extent sense subset broader tariffs europe think basically two models mean considering tariffs already announced hand sense china model hand mexico canada model mean think far course know percent tariffs already seems part know tariffs intended negotiation tactic context negotiation indeed trade mean may elements indeed trade model sense model tariffs understood coercion instrument think question europeans grappling two models basically europe going fall comes tariff story imagine going kind mix two probably tilting towards coercion towards negotiation tactic know still obviously awaiting see happen leads third element think newer relates second first rather allows interpret different far dangerous way second first sense trump two opposed trump far imperial nature right know whereas transactionalism protectionism kind old story steroids imperialism kind feels right mean imperialism essentially idea trump thinking spheres influence good thing explicitly case canada mexico panama greenland gets europe say broadly probably way thinks europe general right trying suggest kind plans kind know marching europe think know essentially probably trump europe land subjugated essentially know transactionalism protectionism sense acquire completely different meaning considering imperialism sense underpins intention course imperial strategy try divide rule right much think something going see particularly case tariffs describing let mean clear try subjugate europe well far easier engaging bilaterally different member states rather collectively european union whole course comes trade know opposed instance defense indeed called european union competence lies imagine likely see trump approaching friends europe beginning perhaps country know relationship donald trump giorgi meloni seems rather good imagine dynamic trump possibly suggest know sweet deals trade know let exempt parmesan italian wine luxury goods whatnot principle course reply offer thanks thanks right thanks please tell ursula von der leyen really address thinking really going kind response going insofar course growing ideological convergence trump represents growing number governments europe gets sort final aspect kind newer element trump administration since emerged far forcefully trump two compared trump nationalism authoritarianism think story relevant united states course europe whereas first trump administration arrived time europe nationalist populism actually going hits europe time know curve know way going far know extent going know actually count around european council nine perhaps belgium ten governments power right either majority minority shareholder coalition government list probably course going grow mean imagine say czech republic austria romania perhaps going added onto list cohort governments convergence views across atlantic actually increases course governments right wing eurosceptic makes divide rule know far trump concerned far security easier implement stop matthijs yeah thank nathalie thing take issue belgian government elements soft nationalist way maybe talk want turn douglas lute ambassador lute chair international defense practices bgr group ceo cambridge global advisors well distinguished chair social sciences military academy west point doug former ambassador nato second obama

fragmenting sometimes short notice vulnerability number vulnerability number two russians occupying ukrainian sovereign territory reliant railroads supply lines always true russian army great distances inside russia forth railroads vulnerable strike particular iconic example kerch strait bridge primary lifeline occupation crimea right kerch strait bridge still stands beyond could sure ukrainians capability taken isolated crimean peninsula think points fact limited scale scope application long range strike system phone rings sorry daughter probably calling laughter assistance biden

hand think think well really afford engage trade war united states china yet time partly longer far china concerned look china angle elements sense play order curry favor trump administration kind two forces pushing opposite directions think hand think instrument far concerned extremely surprised actually used imagine something put table course hope far concerned part negotiation right kind want show got instruments necessarily want use kind hope sense trump going course know know dynamic trade war thing start thinking hoping quite enough dynamic actually evolves think know today say instrument going used united states still quite surprised far less surprised actually used china think far china concerned could really see things moving two different directions direction liana pointing think going strong push opposite direction saying hey really afford trade war china time matthijs wow time invite members cfr members guests join conversation questions reminder meeting record questions online let know right yes please front microphone coming way thank bennett freeman chatham house former state department question really goes extent compartmentalize severe security trade challenges already apparent may well divide european trading security partners tariffs turn really materially damaging extent going affect relationships nato allies respect ukraine fundamentally might response remember know back clinton years used talk separate separate interoperability cooperation potential truly independent least detachable european defense capability talked theory three decades reality never really happened balance tensions risks extent might compartmentalized matthijs excellent question always avoided european defense boring grad student laughter anymore liana want tackle fix yeah take stab think compartmentalization completely think nathalie transactional everything tied everything totally see big basket tariffs ukraine security defense percent already part negotiation taking place across atlantic right see compartmentalization still existent anymore way huge challenge europeans built institutions entirely compartmentalized way nato security commissioner trade member states colleague proposed format across institutions actually deal way linking everything everything able divide little subcommittees point think europeans never come point allow look donald trump way look vladimir putin jinping laughs actions obviously different dependence united states defense fundamental way europeans afford right always backdrop even europeans wanted take tough stance donald trump tariffs security part always backstop relationship constrain europeans hand hopefully prevent relationship completely blowing breaking apart europeans could wanted sure really want consensus want fully move away united build european defense way could ways comes back unconditional nato security provider european pillar within nato united states come back independent european defense whether operationally actually possible invest something could serve purpose time nathalie much better equipped judge could way say well build something serve purposes see stand five years time matthijs hmm doug lute think take twenty thirty years time laughter reason say base prejudiced biased towards europeans reliance american systems viable european defense industrial base replace look zeitenwende right scholz announces zeitenwende gets billion euros know cash right first two systems buys commits zeitenwende chinook helicopter viable european alternatives defense industrial base free world way problems mean problems ukraine war revealed least twenty thirty years front european defense industrial base real option fundamentally europeans troubled look around understand replace anything viable timeframe tariffs know doubts security even way treat allies publicly reminders inherent european vulnerability easily escaped matthijs questions nathalie tocci yeah add mean totally agree liana doug add couple points add angle capacity willingness think capacity question extent tariffs translates trade war translates major economic downturn europe mean interlinkage security economics obviously going reduce capacity europeans good things including know buying american weapons mean element interlinkage think important bear mind another element interlinkage idea tariffs understood instrument coercion let say sake argument perhaps sake argument trump going really pinpoint denmark tariffs obviously aimed coercion respect greenland basically question ukraine related russia related much related know sovereignty territorial integrity member state nato ally well tariffs used instrument coercion know provided doug liana saying absolutely obviously kind limits thinking basically europe change think completely different discussion nice strategically autonomous really yeah mean laughs direct threat security coming know united states matthijs excellent questions yes please kevin sheehan multiplier capital private equity fund former army officer former assistant professor social sciences west point back doug comment regard developing european industrial base year ago announced industrial strategy put defense industry wartime footing obviously year areas europe could develop short twenty thirty years could added west defense defense production particular could see progress call two five years twenty years across board matthijs think laughter sendak well know defer doug thoughts thinking previous question well know talk investment right body going move forward know obviously commissioner defense space trying tackle head long white paper opportunity speak team covering sun moon stars white paper laughs know look address issue see constantly much opportunity much potential really play key role development sustainable industrial base certain platforms certain things formulate something sustainable something cohesive something collaborative yet determined know think going difficult member states want much data know watering things decision making goes see opportunities europe european market need seize opportunities debate know mentioned platforms small drones small unmanned systems know sensors technology changing pace opportunity come low level stuff really expand small anecdote give last week opportunity sit group executives ukrainian technology companies many defense sector necessarily many gentleman know know chatham house know run small drone company make drones year small ukraine jaw dropped laughs big big number many places say tons opportunity channel consistently past three years seen done well point matthijs doug liana lute well think things small garage vintage drone operations possible look ukraine made million drones last year million know exact numbers department defense know across river probably something right tremendous capability could transported small businesses across europe think viable way think sort cold war vintage defense industrial base lines could transitioned mean artillery rounds complicated build right thing see nato together protection foreign influence dual purpose infrastructure infrastructure see pattern especially chinese investment european transportation networks greek port piraeus example port energy infrastructure mass communications remember long ago big drama going hardware europe trying buy ensure china infiltrate systems important remember civilian systems railroads mass communication systems ports europe

europeans able mission example western balkans decade figures try play percent defense spending percent percent crucial thing scenario strategic enablers provided united states quickly europeans sort fill think room bring sort years need massive investment need explain towards european taxpayers either threat perception pull credit card right europe done yet right mean european joint debt yet

always opposed changes debt brake actually introduced current coalition debt brake sort debt brake limits germany use defense spending debt far friedrich merz yet committed seeing debt brake flexible committed percent committed anything beyond whereas politicians open well talk percent percent still optimistic think commit election campaign leader conservative party always angela merkel concerned joint debt know benefiting greeks know debates european union alternative conservatives example another grand coalition social democrats looking exemptions debt brake otherwise pain force taxpayers take much defense spending germany gdp increasing costs much significantly without debt scenario leader chancellor friedrich merz show hague next nato summit without pledge increase defense spending
