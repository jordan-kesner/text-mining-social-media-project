Title: CMV: Saudi Arabia should be removed from the United Nations and stripped of all advantages that come with being part of the UN, due to their sexist governmental policies, harsh laws, and blatant human rights abuses

Post:
Not only does Saudi Arabia violate the basic rights of every human being, several of the rights they infringe on are in direct and gross violation of the [United Nations Human Rights Declaration](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/) set down by the United Nations after the atrocities of World War II. For specifics, the Saudi Arabian government violates:

* Article 3

> Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.

If one observes the practices of the Sharia Law set forth in Saudi Arabia, it becomes clear that these are clearly not respected rights. For one, the women of Saudi Arabia are the subjects and objects of their husbands, having hardly any right to life, as they can be killed for vaguely defined reasons such as "dishonouring the family" or "acting in a manner unbefitting of a woman". Even in the case of the Princesses of Saudi Arabia, there is no distinction. They can be punished as easily and publicly as a servant, without consequences under the law. This also violates their right to security, as they have no guarantee that the government will protect them against any abuses. By extension, their right to liberty is violated, as once again, the male of a house holds immense amounts of legal power over the female. Several examples are found in this quote:

>Under Saudi law, every adult female must have a male relative as her "guardian", whose permission she is required to have in order to travel, study, or work.

Because of the bastardized version of Islam many of the powerful men of Saudi Arabia choose to follow, they interpret many things from their religious texts, including that women are the source of all evil, that they should not be allowed to study or work, and that if they do they will negatively affect everyone around them. Due to this, the right to liberty in Saudi Arabia for Saudi woman is not only de facto non-existant but also de jure non-existant. The Mutawa of Saudi Arabia are very powerful as they serve as the religious police. They are so powerful that they have the power to prosecute a member of the Saudi Royal Family, which, to my knowledge, has never been done. The point is that they serve as a very powerful force in the oppression of  women in Saudi Arabia, and given the power of Sharia Law over the Saudis, they easily cast shadows on the liberty of all the women of Saudi Arabia.

* Article 5

>No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

This is probably the most infringed on right in the Kingdom. The punishments under the Law in Saudi Arabia include, but are not limited to, lashes, stoning, drowning, death by firing squad, death by crucifixion, death by beheading, with the option of public punishments, just as one would offer with a spectator sport. If Saudi Arabia allowed as much choice in the living of live as they did in the ending of life, they would be much better off.

Out of these items, three stand out. Cruxifiction, stoning, and beheading are all barbaric and extremely cruel ways of punishment. In the case of beheading, during the process, I can only imagine that the subject would experience immense pain as the executioner proceeded to cut through his throat, then the thick muscles of his neck, and then all the way through the spinal cord. There is no debate that this is a violation of Article 5. Cruxifiction , for those who don't know, means that you would be nailed to a plank of wood or some such surface to bleed out, or more likely, die of starvation or stoning while nailed to the wall like an animal skin. I'm not even going to bother explaining why that infringes son Article 5. Lastly, stoning. Since when has having stones hurled at you a normal punishment? Not only is it extremely degrading, it is also extremely cruel, and extremely stupid. I think I've said enough on this topic.

* Article 7

>All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.

Women are not equal before the law. I mentioned it above under Article 3, but once again, it is blatantly clear that women are not treated as equals under the law. Not only are they completely unrepresented in the Saudi Arabian government, even the Royal women have barely any power. With a court system, law enforcement system, army, and executive system all run by men, I would find it very hard to believe that they are given equal protection or treatment under the law. The simple fact that it is completely legal for a man to kill his wife with "proper reason" is evidence enough for this point.

* Article 9

>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.

I'm not even going to bother to explain this one myself, and I will instead leave you with [this](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30744693?ocid=socialflow_twitter), [this](http://www.arabianbusiness.com/saudi-arabia-executes-54-people-in-first-3-months-of-2015-588431.html), and [this](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/siti-zainab-saudi-arabia-beheads-mentally-ill-female-domestic-worker-angering-indonesia-1496492).

* Article 10

>Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.

I'm losing steam writing about this, so I'll leave you with a few quotes to prove my point:

>Western-based human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have criticized the activities of both the Mabahith and the Mutawa, as well as a number of other aspects of human rights in Saudi Arabia. These include the number of executions, the range of offenses which are subject to the death penalty, the lack of safeguards for the accused in the criminal justice system, the treatment of homosexuals, the use of torture, the lack of religious freedom, and the highly disadvantaged position of women. The Albert Shanker Institute and Freedom House have also reported that "Saudi Arabia's practices diverge from the concept of the rule of law."

>Courts in Saudi Arabia observe few formalities and the country's first criminal procedure code, issued in 2001, has been largely ignored. Decisions are made without juries and usually by a single judge.

* Article 13

>(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.
(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.

Saudi woman require permission from the head of the house (husband, father, or male relative) to leave the country. They can be sequestered in their own homes and forbidden from leaving, returning, or any number of things that would restrict their movement. I quoted this above, but it is also relevant here:

>Under Saudi law, every adult female must have a male relative as her "guardian", whose permission she is required to have in order to travel, study, or work.

* Article 16

>(1) Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.
(2) Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.
(3) The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.

Every single god damn right in Article 13 is utterly non-existant for the women of Saudi Arabia. They do NOT have equal rights during marriage, as a women has to go through the highly biased court systems to achieve a divorce whereas a man need only say, "On this day I have divorced you." They certainly do not marry with consent, teenage girls often marrying 55 or 60 year old men, maybe even older than their own father. And if you think that the family is protected under the law, from, say, a father threatening to execute his daughter for "indecency", then I advise you look into exactly how that doesn't happen.

* Article 18

>Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.

Saudi Arabia has a de jure restriction on the right of freedom of religion, as the only allowed religion is Sunni Islam, and Sunni Islam alone. No other denominations of Islam or ANY OTHER RELIGION are allowed to be practiced. Anyone marrying a Saudi citizen or attempting to be a Saudi national MUST convert to Islam, with no exceptions. 

* Article 19

>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

Censoring of the media, of the press, and of the basic expression of thought through speech are all restricted heavily in Saudi Arabia. No further explanation is needed, simply look at the first article linked above under Article 9.

* Article 20

>(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
(2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association.

The second point above is infringed on; by being forced to convert to Islam, you are also being forced to join the mosque and participate in practices such as praying at the specified times and observing religious customs as part of the mosque...unless you're a woman, in which case I don't believe that you are allowed in a mosque. But I may be wrong about this.

* Article 21

>(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.
(2) Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country.
(3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.

They are a monarchy and a theocracy, breaking point three of Article 21. Women are allowed no representation in the government, breaking point one in Article 21. I don't believe there is a such thing as public service in Saudi Arabia, so point two can be entirely disregarded in this case.

* Article 23

>(1) Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.
(2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.
(3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.
(4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.

Women DO NOT have the inherent right to work, nor the right to even have an education so that they might one day work. In the case of equal pay, women simply not being allowed to work takes care of that issue right there. Point three of Article 23 can be entirely ignored under these circumstances, and point 4 is entirely untrue in Saudi Arabia, as I doubt the poor laborers have ever heard of the word "union" used in that context.

* Article 26

>(1) Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.
(2) Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.
(3) Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.

WOMEN DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION. Again and again this will surface. Women are extremely restricted in all manner of ways, violating their basic rights as human beings. Furthermore, the one-sided Islamic based education that people are allowed to go through in Saudi Arabia is little more than indoctrination of the falsifications that have plagued the bastardized version of Islam all too many people think is the true interpretation of the religion!

Finally, I have finished cataloging all of their violations of ONLY the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This was **established by the UN itself** and is being **broken by one of it's main members**. If this isn't grounds for removal, I don't know what is.

I know Saudi Arabia is a large economic player, is one of the founding members of several Arab confederates and alliances, as well as a major player in OPEC, but by sending our (United States) President to that country, allowing them to serve in the United Nations, an organization committed to stopping violence and promoting fairness and equality, and maintaining an allied relationship with them is not only hypocritical, it is morally wrong. I don't see how one could argue that they shouldn't be removed from the United Nations, nor can I see how one could justify ANY of the actions or laws listed above.

If you want to change my mind, I'd be open to listening to the economic, geo-political, and military perspectives of this argument, but if you insist on arguing morality here, I'm open to hearing it.

Thank you in advance for reading and responding thoughtfully!

EDIT2: THANK YOY FOR GETTING ME TO THE FRONT PAGE OF CMV!!!

And thank you for all the thoughtful responses. I'm in school right now but when I get home I will respond to ALL of them, I promise!

EDIT3: The overwhelming response to this post has been absolutely enlightening and very educational. I'd like to especially thank /u/Omega037, /u/tropical_chancer, /u/GTFErinyes, /u/GnosticTemplar, /u/crankypants15, and /u/mr-tibbs for providing excellent points and countering my arguments very eloquently. These were true counter-arguments and not only gave me additional information, but were good rhetoric and made me think twice about my stance. I'm going to leave this thread open, as I'm hoping that I'll get additional replies as well thought out as the ones below, but I will be closing this thread at 12:00 PST because everyone here has practically changed my view on the issue. 

Thanks, everyone!

The United Nations is, foremost, a safe and central place for nations to deliberate, negotiate, and discuss issues between states.  It may not solve those issues, but at least provides a platform for people to try.

In order to make this successful, the UN has tried to be as inclusive as possible.  The only way it can have legitimacy as the place for all nations to discuss matters of state is to have nearly universal inclusion regardless of what members do.  For example:

1. Syria was using chemical weapons on its people recently.  It is still a member.

2. North Korea has horrible labor/reeducation camps where children and other family members of "traitors" are sent to die.  It is still a member.

3. Rwanda committed genocide of the Tutsi people.  It is still a member.

At many points of time in its history, countries that were actively at war with each other were still at the UN.  This might not seem like a big deal, but it really is.  During the fiercest, most hated moments of a conflict, the UN still exists as the one place that representatives from both sides are together without arms. 
As someone who has lived in Saudi Arabia, I can tell you that you're being very hyperbolic about the situation for women in Saudi Arabia, and in some cases just plain wrong. Women can (and do) both work and receive an education in Saudi Arabia. The largest university for women in the world, Princess Nora University is in Saudi Arabia. Its so big it even has its own metro system. There are over 50,000 Saudi women studying at the university and can study everything from English to interior design. 

You also have to remember that Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy. It isn't a democracy, so things like elections and the right to vote aren't exactly applicable. A few years ago the government did allow for what are basically local municipal elections, and first said men and women could vote but then said only men could vote. The King did announce after the election that women will be able to vote in the next election. The mutawwa also hassle men just as much as they do women (if not more) I certainly has my run ins with the mutawwa while I was there.

I was fortunate enough to meet several Saudi women, and all of them have basically been the opposite of the stereotypical "oppressed Muslim woman." I met Saudi women who had recieved PhDs from American universities, Saudi women who were doctors, and even housewives. Saudi women tend to have very big personalities and are particularly apt at managing familial politics and expectations. Saudis are VERY VERY family oriented people. Everything comes back to their family. In addition, you have to realize that many Saudi women are more or less fine with their situation, or at least don't think of it as some sort of huge human rights violation. What Saudi women do worry about are things like the economy, security, opportunities for their children, etc., they're just like women all over the world. In addition women tend to be more conservative than men. One female doctor I met had studied and lived in the US for a while but decided to come back to Saudi because she said she felt more comfortable and safe in Saudi. Many women actually support the things we think of as being "oppressive." Basically people living outside Saudi Arabia don't truly understand the situation for women in Saudi Arabia and don't know Saudi women's actual views or desires. 

Now of course, I'm not going to say the situation for Saudi women is equal or that they have complete freedom or anything like that, but the truth of the matter is that women all over the world face certain inequalities and restrictions. Women's inequality is certainly not only restricted to Saudi Arabia; its a world-wide problem. Nor are things like human rights violations. Plenty of countries are committing gross human rights violations. If we start kicking countries out of the UN for women's inequality and human rights violations, we will be kicking out more than just Saudi Arabia; we'll be kicking out the US, Russia, China, etc. 
Holding Saudi to these standards would also mean the United States would have the same consequences. 
Sure the mechanisms are different but state sponsored discrimination is state sponsored discrimination. 
2 cents worth.
One important side point, in addition to those others have raised about the UN's original purpose, is that your list of human rights is taken from a *very* western-centric view.

Not only have many non-western countries criticized the UN declaration of human rights, many of them have taken the articles and come up with completely different interpretations. 

For instance, Article 5:

>No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

In the case of Saudi Arabia, they simply cite their adherence to Islam, recognized as one of the major world religions, for the fact that their punishments are neither cruel, inhuman, or unjust. Their religion commands them to perform such punishments and as thus, it is in their eyes the *ultimate* just form of punishment. They can just as easily turn it around and say "you using the electric chair has no moral basis while beheading is sanctioned by our holy texts" and consider our values inhumane.
You wasted your time trying to convince us that Saudi Arabia is bad. Everyone knows that. 

You shouldve spent time convincing us that "bad" countries should not be allowed in the UN.
Are those articles the UN makes are more like suggestions of how a government should run. They aren't rules. 

It is kind of like an old neighbor who posts notes on people's door as to what behavior is okay or not

I see your mind has already been changed, so maybe it's too late, but anyway.

The main thing that leaps to my mind is that you've listed several ways that Saudi government contravenes articles in the UDHR, a UN document. Saudi Arabia can be held accountable for this because they are a UN member, and therefore meant to follow the rules laid out in this document. That's not to say that they successfully *are* being held to account, but that's beside the point.

If Saudi Arabia is kicked out of the UN, then they have no requirement to pay any attention to UN laws. It would be very difficult to hold them to account based on UN definitions of what a country should and shouldn't do.

...so if you want to hold them accountable by UN laws, then they need to first be a member of the UN. From there, you can start pushing for change. By kicking them out, you're restricting your legal options for challenging their current practices.
Regarding the punishments: 

I have a friend who lives in SA. The gov't does not actually use these extreme punishments  on the population. However, the laws are there to appease the extremist factions. 
The gov't in control right now is actually pretty moderate, but they can't let the extremists know that, so the moderates let those laws stay on the books. It's one way the balance of peace is maintained. 

Just because it doesn't meet your preconceived notion of peace does not mean it's bad. Their notion of peace is very different, than say, America's. The Middle East has been under stress for quite a few decades now. Any minute step towards peace matters, no matter how small. 

There's a big difference between laws being on the books, and laws actually being used. There are many laws in the US that are just not enforced either, or just occasionally enforced. One being, in Michigan, it is illegal to swear in front of women and children. Last time it was enforced was in the 1990s, and that was a one time thing when a man was probably verbally abusing his wife and kids in front of an off-duty cop. 

So, let's see the times when the actual Saudi gov't has used these punishments, instead of some extremist faction. Getting your information from Fox News is not the same as living there. 



The simplest explanation of why modern countries don't outright reject and criticize Saudi Arabia:

Oil.

This world runs on fossil fuels, and no major country wants to cut themselves off from Saudi Arabia's massive oil supply.

That oil also gets Saudi Arabia money, which they can use to wield additional influence.
