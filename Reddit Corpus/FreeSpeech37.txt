I haven't read the opinion yet but any ruling that curtails schools from punishing students for what they say outside of school is a good ruling.
Good. Schools should not have any say or control in what a student does when not on school grounds or attending school functions.

This asinine idea that "As a student you are always representing the school" is total bullshit.
I live a town away. My parents and many family members went to this school. The district wasted so much money over this.
They shouldn't have disciplined her for what she said off campus. They should have just acted really passive aggressive and bitchy toward her in that Mean Girls sort of way.
Utterly unsurprising that Thomas just cites a bunch of his own concurrences/dissents in some bizarre effort to justify overturning *Tinker*. The guy *hates* the idea that students have free speech.
Awesome. Now fire that coach, principal, and the school board for wasting tax payers money trying to appeal. Because fuck that coach, fuck that school, and most importantly, fuck cheer.
A government funded school, which people are forced to attend by the government, payed for by the people, is silencing students...fuck that and all the fake ass lefty libertarians on this sub who pretend it's a private institution. It's not. It's time the lefties on this sub get called out too.
