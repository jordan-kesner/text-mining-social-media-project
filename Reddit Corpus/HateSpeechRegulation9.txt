Title: Does freedom of speech exist online? (let's debate!)

Post:
Hi! I just created a blog post about freedom of speech on the Internet: http://truelifecommstudent.blogspot.com/2014/02/does-freedom-of-speech-exist-online.html

TL;DR: You should be allowed to post whatever you want online, but you probably shouldn't post anything controversial.

Opinions?

Your teach probably has tenure? If your teacher is right then he'd probably be supporting the idea that the duck dynasty dude should still have a job with A&E. But I'm assuming that's probably not true. 
Ok, haha. I was assuming probably too much. I just remember having so many professors rant on their soap boxes. Having been graduated and at the grind for some time now, I'm realizing some were way out of touch. Or then again, maybe "times have changed." Either way, I feel like business rights vs. free speech can clash pretty well. However, I'd have to side with the right of business owners to eliminate candidates that seem like crazies in the social media world.
