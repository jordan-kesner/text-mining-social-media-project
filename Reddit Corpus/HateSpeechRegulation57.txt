Why isn't there words like "Buddhistophobia?" Or "Jewophobia?" Or "Amishophibia?" What is about Islam that drive so many people to irrationally fear the murderous wrath of Mohomet's armies of the jihad? Apparently, this is a question on one will ever find the answer to reading about these things in the pliant press.
Calling it Islamophobia is every ethnocentric of the Western media and perhaps an example of racism of against Asian people.  Culturally protective is a better way to phrase it.
Islam has been in China for almost a thousand years. Even if you don't like Muslim immigrants, Islam in China has zero to do with immigration. 

On a personal level, I've never had any issues with any Muslim I've ever met, and in fact I know many with whom I trust my life.  But, that's just me.
