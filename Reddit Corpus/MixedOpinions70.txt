Title: CMV: Transgender (specifically MtF) athletes have an unfair advantage in strength-based sports and should only be able to participate in their biological gender group.

Post:
This is in response to the post that hit the front page recently which can be seen here: http://www.outsports.com/2017/3/20/14983388/transgender-weightlifting-laurel-hubbard-wins

Biologically speaking, the male gender is already predisposed to stronger traits and as a response the Olympic Committee split competitions into two groups so that both genders have an "equal playing field". But with more acceptance and social tolerance, along with more transgender people coming out, problems have arose and will continue to rise until this gets dealt with and, to me, it's unfair and should be given strict guidelines and have no gender fluidity in the eyes of competitors.

Thanks guys, CMV! :)

Edit: Keep it civil guys!

Here's the policy of the National Women's Hockey League.  It's common sense really.  They did have a FtM person (Harrison Browne) who retired this season.  As far as I know they have not yet had someone who who plays under the MtF connotation

>Eligibility Guidelines

>Considering the most up-to-date medical and expert information available at the time of the implementation of this policy, participation is open to:

>1. People designated female at birth, regardless of their gender identity.

>1.1 The athlete may not take testosterone hormone therapy. Athletes transitioning to male who undergo hormone therapy will be ineligible to compete.

>2. Those who transition from male to female are eligible to compete under the following conditions:

>2.1. The athlete has declared that her gender identity is female. The declaration cannot be changed, for sporting purposes, for a minimum of four years.

>2.2. The athlete must demonstrate that her total testosterone level in serum is within typical limits of women athletes.

>2.3. The athlete's total testosterone level in serum must remain in the typical range of women athletes throughout the period of desired eligibility to compete in the female category.

>2.4. Compliance with these conditions may be monitored by testing. In the event of non-compliance, the athlete’s eligibility in the league will be suspended for 12 months.

OP, be aware that an imbalance can happen when a [female to male trans person is forced to compete against female athletes.](http://ktla.com/2017/02/24/transgender-high-school-wrestler-target-of-texas-lawsuit/)
Something about MtF hormone treatment that you may not be aware of: Before I went on HRT, I weighed 77 kg. A month later, I weighed 72kg. My body was analyzed with a fancy machine at the hospital, and they could tell me that this happened because I lost 6kg of muscle, and gained 1kg of fat.

When you go on proper HRT, your body just goes "Well, I guess we don't need any of this any more!", and a lot of your muscles go away. Since then, I've never been able to outcompete any man strength-wise. Hormone treatment should bring MtF trans people in line with the female mean.

**Edit:** 
Oops, I made the mistake of weighing in on trans issues. I was just trying to bring in a perspective, rather than argue for any actual policy on transgender athletes. It seemed that the OP was not aware of the extent of the effects of HRT on muscle development, and I thought that providing my personal experience would be a good way to provide context and perspective on what happens to a body during such a transition. I am not trying to argue against the fact that trans women generally have different bodies from cis women, or arguing that my personal experience is evidence or the experience of all trans women. Rather than respond to every single comment in my inbox, I'll just say the folowing:

This topic comes up whenever a trans athlete performs highly in any sport. Many more compete, but fall short of the mark. This never makes the news, because "Trans woman finishes 59th in 107-person race" is not an attractive headline. Most sports organisations allow trans athletes to compete after a certain amount of time on HRT, but they still retain some characteristics of their birth sex. This much is uncontroversial. What we simply do not know, is if these *differences* between trans and cis people constitute an *advantage*. It's all well and good to theorize about bone density, but the evidence is simply lacking, and all sports are different. Given that, people generally fall into two camps:

1: Trans people should be allowed in gender-specific sports until it is proven their trans past gives them an unfair advantage.

2: Trans people should be disallowed from gender-specific sports until it is proven their trans past does not give them an unfair advantage.

Personally, I lean towards number 1, simply because it seems like the easiest way to get the evidence we currently lack. If trans people consistently outperform cis people in a sport, that seems like it could be cause for action. If they don't, I see no reason to ban them. The only way we know if trans people outperform cis people, though, is to let them compete. And then use statistics on the outcomes, and not gut feelings. That's my two cents.

Are you also for restricting female atheletes who have conditions that cause their body to produce more male hormones, such as [hyperandrogenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperandrogenism)? Why or why not?
I'd like to bring up a point I don't see listed very much in here.

There's a lot of pro sports that have no gender requirements. There are de facto mens category, but not de jure.

Take say Golf PGA Tour, football with the NFL, and professional chess competitions. All 3 of these are actually open to anyone regardless of gender.

However these for a variety of reasons are all dominated by men so in this case only their counterpart "women only" leagues are the only ones doing the restricting. The purpose of these restrictions isn't purely to do with actual differences in ability - strength plays a role certainly in football, but only deals mostly with drive difference for golf, and provides no difference in chess.

What we instead see is an area traditionally male dominant with more male interest and thus males tend to simply be at a higher level. If you have 10,000 males and 100 females your say top 1,000 statistically is only likely to contain 10 females.

So these restrictive leagues are designed to give more publicity and backing to raise the level of skill of other groups playing catchup. So in the case of transgender it is more a question if they need help reaching the same level of skill or if they are already there in which case they can join the general pool.

Now as for physical limitations we'd look more at things like the NBA vs WNBA and MMA fights that have recently taken off.

These 2 are sports in which genetic physical ability already plays a huge role. Height, weight, muscle. MMA even has weight classes to separate out things.

However here we still see the "men's" divisions open to either gender while only the WNBA and women's division are restrictive. And while you could argue raw physical ability, the actual skill levels alone are the more pressing issue.

Pretty much every NBA player can dunk. However, there's a fairly small number of women in the WNBA that can to the point where you can youtube clips of every single WNBA dunk. This is just an obvious skill, but it applies more up and down the board - skill just naturally increases over time in a sport.

MMA the women are about 10 years behind men in skill. At the top of the sport we have recent fights like ronda rousey vs holly holm. Ronda specializes in judo grappling with a very weak stand up game. Holly holm is a boxer with little to no grappling game. It's much more of a one trick to get there.

The men's division though is full of people who have both boxing + wrestling background or jujitsu + kickboxing or any combination of striking martial arts mixed with grappling martial arts. You simply see more knowledge of different styles.

So while you could make a comparison of strength and physical ability you first have to get to a point of technical and skill viability at a similar level which simply isn't there yet. It will be eventually, but it's a slow gradual process.
Mod here. Remember rule 1- you have to try to change their view in topline posts. If you think OP is right then you can agree in the comments below. 

This comment is exempt from rule 1 as a sticky comment.
From personal experience: on mtf hormone therapy myself, from my experience doing crossfit, starting out I was way ahead of any new woman there, but behind even the worst off new guy. But with the women that had been there a year, I never could really catch up with them in just 3 hours a week. At the high end it's about work.

From why it's allowed: there's a ten to fifteen percent difference between men's and women's performance. Women with abnormally high testosterone are allowed to compete in the olympics because mathematically they aren't over represented in competition (top medal earners range from high testosterone to very low) transgender women are kept below the levels that cis women are allowed to have and compete

Now about the person that won the lifting competition:

1. Males subdivide into two more weight classes then women

2. She was 15-20kg heavier then second place because they cut women's classes at 90kg

3. Her performance was good, but nowhere near a top women's score, and would not be an Olympic medal lift by a long shot

4. Some of her best competitors cut weight to get out of her class, like the transgender male wrestler, having less competition is an advantage
I don't see a comment on puberty yet, so I'll weigh in a bit.

> CMV: Transgender (specifically MtF) athletes have an unfair advantage in strength-based sports and should only be able to participate in their biological gender group.

There is absolutely no reason to believe that all transwomen athletes have an advantage over their female counterparts, as your assertion makes.

The defining biological trigger that gives males an advantage over females is the presence of high amounts of testosterone.  Testosterone changes the form of the body, bone density, and aids in the development and maintenance of muscle mass.

However pre-pubescent children do not have high quantities of testosterone. If a pre-pubescent transgirl speaks out about distress regarding their identity, they can be placed on puberty blockers prior to transition. In these cases, their 'first' puberty may be delayed, but there is absolutely no advantage being given to them by testosterone. These transwomen would then be able to compete on an "equal playing field."

Unfortunately, in this case, transwomen are in a position where, if they go through their male puberty, their bodies are effectively doping themselves for years, in regards to the various levels of testosterone. Since the effects of testosterone include irreversible differences (Such as bone density and skeletal shape), this does create a clear advantage.

Transmen, while outside of the scope of the CMV, face different issues, wherein their testosterone dosage is often higher than a male's natural production. Sports groups try to make efforts for appropriate inclusion, but transmen may be 'effectively doping' as well.

It's a complicated issue, but one that I believe needs to be analyzed on a case by case basis regarding past medical history, rather than just banning all transwomen from women's sports. Because a blanket ban simply lets buzzwords blind the decision without any regard for the reality of the various individual's situations.
