I reported a major double whammy post on facebook, firstly it was posted by an account clearly stealing profile images from a moderately well know instagram person (8 million followers, and you could reverse the images easily) while simultaneously dropping the N bomb 5 fucking times in 1 post.

Got a response that the post didn't break their rules
This is one of the big problems with how all social media is run. They emulate and exacerbate a lot of social issues because of the need to sell ads. 
I posted a picture of a bag of cheese on my story and “LMK ⛽️🔥💸” and it was flagged automatically for selling illicitl substances taken down and I was given a strike lol. I appealed it and they said nope still violated community guidelines lmao. They are a joke.
> Meta declined an interview, but a representative told CBC in a email it will review the examples in the report.

Translation: Everything it working as it should and we aren't going to do anything to change it. We'll take some token action now that all the damage is done.
Instagram/Meta ignore 93% of obviously terrible/abusive/scammy content.


Their "report" system is a joke. 


And they are under no pressure to change. 


Anyone who says "small government works" should just look at tech companies like Meta and the shit they get away with due to being completely unregulated and unpunished. 
Deleted my Instagram recently. Left Facebook sometime around 2016/17 … it’s just a bill board on your phone. Between the actual ads, suggested posts, and influencers my feed was just trying to sell me stuff. No real benefits for me the user
I have reported blatant racism, hate groups, images of criminal violence that people were boasting about, etc. and every single time Instagram says they did not remove it and that they found nothing wrong with it.
Insta is such a cesspool. Every post of a public woman is filled with the most cynical, racist, and rapey comments its absolutely disgusting
