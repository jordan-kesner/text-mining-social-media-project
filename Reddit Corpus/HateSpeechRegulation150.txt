With IG, or probably more specifically Instagramâ€™s API. It makes the functionality of scheduling apps unreliable or sometimes unavailable without warning.
Some scheduling websites don't offer enough analytics or insights on post-performance, making it difficult to make data-driven decisions for future content.
Most of us buy multitool platforms that happen to have scheduling, rather than buying a scheduling tool for its own sake. Especially as most platforms have scheduling capability built in now. I just went through a procurement and here was my shopping list, hope it helps:

Built in UTM builder
Aggregate inbox of all dms/comments across all the platforms I need to manage 
Library section, so I can tag and store well-performing content to reuse
Suggested best time to post based on in-platform behaviour, and adjusted per platform
Ability to save clusters of frequently used hashtags so I don't need to copy and paste them over from a doc or remember them
Ability to plan my content calendar within platform, and send for approval without that being counted as a second user

I've used all the main schedulers and have strong opinions. Please feel free to message me with any specific follow up questions, happy to help x
