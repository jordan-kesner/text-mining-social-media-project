Title: Why doesn’t Biden have better messaging / why isn’t he more active?

Post:
The Biden administration has had a lot of accomplishments, in the past 3 years.

However, Biden himself I feel has very poor messaging and an image problem which is why he’s polling as poorly as he is.

Let’s consider his two most recent Democratic predecessors in the Oval Office, Clinton and Obama.

Clinton was always on the move, always giving a speech somewhere, having town halls often talking to regular people, he was always on the go and made himself, his message, and his ideas very clear, and he sold them well to the public.

Obama likewise was always on the move, made himself a presence on early social media, on the TV circuit, he also made his case to the American people and did so successfully, leading to a second term.

My question is, why isn’t Biden more “out there”? Very rarely do you hear about a speech. Very rarely any sort of town hall type event. He’s almost like the invisible man, compared to the last four Presidents. 

I feel like this image issue and this sense of him not really being on the public radar is a part of his poor polling. The question is, why no course correction? Why no attempt to further sell Biden the man to the public?

It looks like from his calendar, he has been in at least 4 different states just this week making speeches.

I think it's just not particularly exciting to get clicks.  FoxNews viewers aren't enraged by his speeches, and neither are MSNBC viewers.  Therefore, he doesn't end up trending in social feeds the way that Trump or Obama do.
He *is* out there. He's given a number of major speeches in the last two weeks. But if Trump so much as farts in the courtroom, that's what dominates the media cycle. The same mistakes of 2016 are being repeated.
The news really doesn't cover anything he does unless he flubs a word.  Then they run 50 stories about him being old.  

For example. [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-biden-delivers-remarks-on-internet-access-economy-at-campaign-event-in-north-carolina](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-biden-delivers-remarks-on-internet-access-economy-at-campaign-event-in-north-carolina)  Even on google there is very little mention of it. 

Trump's courtroom antics are going to get more press.
Biden cannot control for-profit corporate media.  He cannot control that corporate media prioritizes creating drama and fear to drive clicks/views for profits.  Biden could be the most active and productive president in the history of humankind, but you wouldn't know it if all your information comes from corporate media.  

Corporate media is not trying to inform the public, they are only interested in making a buck.  A boring productive president offers no real value to the corporate media bottom line.  Drama is the only thing they will cover.  Which is a big reason why you don't see too much about Biden.  He's boring but good.

Realistically, the job of the president of the united states is difficult and demanding.  The president should not be ubiquitous on every damned channel bragging about nonesense or making excuses for their incompetence or mal/mis/non-feasance.

The problem we have as a society is that corporate media got drunk on the drama machine of a  reality tv president named Trump.
Biden has been doing all of that? He was just making a speech in a smallish town in PA this week, he’s got speeches and appearances all over the country all over his socials, but the media would rather talk about all of trumps many trials so we don’t hear about it.
I strongly disagree with the idea this is a communication issue, or that his administration is bad at communication. 

My take is that good or positive news will just not resonate at all, regardless of how good it is or the people delivering it. I am going to copy what another commentator stated as it sums up my feelings on the post COVID climate perfectly.

> think it comes down to the fact that we’re living in a social paradigm where optimism, satisfaction, and gratitude, even where entirely appropriate, are looked upon with mockery and hostility, while grievance, outrage, and conspiracy-adjacent cynicism are automatically seen as signs of wisdom and free thinking.

> People are performing grievance for social clout. It comes down to that. Defending the president or the government or the economy, under any circumstances, is cringe, corny, and deeply uncool. This is reinforced not just among the young but the middle aged and old. It’s a death spiral of attention-seeking, theatricalized mistrust of authority and expertise that could spell the final break between material conditions and government policy, and ultimately the obsolescence of democracy.

Well, my guess is this:

If you start messaging years before re-election, then the message is stale when election time comes.

I think a better question is why the media doesn't seem to be reporting objectively about his performance.

And I think the answer is that the big wigs running the media want another Trump presidency because of the ratings. They are willing to fling the country into dictatorship if it means more money.

And that's a sad commentary on the state of our country.
Negativity drives engagement, it's a media issue. This is what happens in capitalism at this point, we have too much unregulated media and a lot of citizens are being misinformed so the media company can make more money.
