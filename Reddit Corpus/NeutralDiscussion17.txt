I noticed no censorship,  people are still free to talk about whichever candidate they like,  keep in mind no one is required to care or listen to someone's political drivel
I'm gonna assume we're talking about Biden, not a secret robot duplicate of him codenamed "Bideon".

I haven't noticed any change in censorship, whether from media platforms or imposed by users.
You mean Reddit down voting and blocking any conservative points of view? They have done that ever since they were bought by a Chinese controlled company.
Recently I tried asking why we cant have homes inspected before purchasing a house in order to hold sellers and builders accountable and it got removed:
Then why is IG allowing some political views and throwing them on my feed but not allowing ideas that support and or go against the feed/posts presented?
