I got banned from Twitter by suggesting that parents against vaping were mostly middle age women consuming large amounts of Chardonay .
Apparently it was hate speech..or something.

Fuck Twitter
I don't really care for what Twitter staff have to say, especially when it comes to content moderation. Their track record of idiocy and biases speaks for itself
What has Elon Musk said or done that makes him a racist? Iâ€™m asking an honest question, not trying to making a point.
