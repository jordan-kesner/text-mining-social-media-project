Ya just looked it up he got a special developers version so the game wasn't starting from the beginning where you have no powers and the game play might seem boring, instead he starts in some random area with a quest and all the powers available to make the game look better
How much money is paid to "online influencers" (aka shills) to post on reddit?  How many governments have cadres of "online influencers" posting on reddit?

Im on mobile, but someone should do the Google/YouTube thing and post links for people who want to understand. 
PewDiePie is probably the most annoying youtuber out there, and it makes me feel good to know a mountain of shit and bad PR is coming down on him.
