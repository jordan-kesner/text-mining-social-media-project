Title: CMV: Ron DeSantis will be the Republican nominee for President for the 2024 general election

Post:
It will either be Trump or DeSantis.  Ultimately I believe Trump will back DeSantis because Ron is is gaining serious momentum and he is receiving positive praise from leaders across both aisles.  My view hinges on why DeSantis is a better candidate than Trump.

1. His Covid response has been remarkable.  While Cuomo was made to be the media darling of how to handle Covid and writing books (and being a creep), DeSantis has followed the science by focusing vaccines based on age and those at risk, and not by profession.  He also opened up the economy and his state has a lower unemployment rate than the nation.  Disneyland is somehow open in Florida but not California.  Because of this, he will easily win Florida and won’t need to campaign there.

2. He’s not afraid to fight the mainstream media when they purposely post fake news (see 60 minutes).  Republicans, some who feel there is a left wing bias in the MSM, will like this, particularly as we see the media get exposed for false and or misleading stories.

3. He will do very well in public speaking events.  He is much more composed than Trump and is better at articulating his message without his press secretary having to clarify his statements.  I’ve heard on one sports talk radio and he is very intelligent, composed, thoughtful and articulate.  He will win over those turned off by Trump’s terrible communication style.

4. Trump can still have his rallies, get his America first message and ensure he stays relevant given he is a DeSantis ally.  Trump base is a small minority of the Republican Party despite his high party approval rating.  DeSantis is not an “us vs them” type leader like Trump, so he will appeal to many moderates.  If Trump has a platform, he’s happy.  

There are 2 aspects to my view, that DeSantis will be the nominee, and he will be a better nominee than Trump.

Florida law limits governors to two terms. DeSantis is young for American politics (only 42) and serving his first term. There is a much better chance he would run again for governor, and then run for president later in life.
>It will either be Trump or DeSantis. Ultimately I believe Trump will back DeSantis because Ron is is gaining serious momentum and he is receiving positive praise from leaders across both aisles.

If you believe this, you still don't understand Trump. Trump will not back someone else. His narcissism won't let him. 

>1.  Trump base is a small minority of the Republican Party despite his high party approval rating.

30-40 percent is not a small minority. Its a significant voting block.
Predictions are a waste of time.  Three years before the election, nobody in their right mind would have predicted that Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, or Donald Trump would be the nominee, much less President of the United States.

What makes sense today, won’t make sense three years from now.
Ron DeSantis is the Scott Walker of 2024. They both were boosted by the conservative media early on because they took a bold and controversial stand on something (COVID restrictions & Labor Unions, respectively), both are charismatically-challenged governors who are not all that popular in their home states, and do not have the political skills or media savvy-ness necessary to survive on a national stage. 

Trump, to his credit, is actually media savvy and knows how to leverage media coverage to take all the oxygen out of the room. 

The fact that DeSantis has an adversarial relationship with the media, but it does not serve him in such a way is a red flag to his prospective candidacy.
> His Covid response has been remarkable.

**His** Covid response was disasterous.  **He** basically didn't have a Covid response.  **His** response to Covid was to act like it didn't exist.

Fortunately, local leaders in all the counties with major cities (and most without) ignored the governor and enacted their own local mask mandates and capacity restrictions.  If not for the local leaders taking the virus seriously and bailing out DeSantis's ass, Florida would have easily had more deaths and cases per capita than any other state.
Lol if you believe trump will back anybody but himself you are high. Trump does not give a dam about the gop if he is not the leader.
DeSantis Covid response:

[Axios](https://www.axios.com/florida-covid-response-reopening-ron-desantis-0b432cf6-a6ba-41cf-82c0-0148158581cf.html):

>**The Los Angeles Times** [compared](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-09/florida-vs-california-who-had-better-covid-response) Florida and California's responses:  
>  
>"California imposed myriad restrictions that battered the economy, and have left most public school students learning at home for a year. ... Florida adopted a more laissez-faire approach decried by public health experts — allowing indoor restaurant dining, leaving masks optional and getting children back in classrooms sooner."  
>  
>But, it points out, "**If California had Florida’s death rate, roughly 6,000 more Californians would be dead from COVID-19, and tens of thousands of additional patients likely would have landed in already overburdened hospitals. And if Florida had California’s death rate, roughly 3,000 fewer Floridians would be dead from COVID-19."**

If DeSantis tries to run on his covid management he's going to suffer badly from the scrutiny. 

He may, indeed, be the GOP nominee for president in '24. Trump will not endorse him, or anybody else. Trump only endorses Trump. 

And the response to any candidate who has been such a fervent supporter of Trump, Trump's false claims of election fraud in 2020, Trump's promotion of the rally that saw ten thousand people gather to try to overturn the most closely examined, thoroughly litigated election in American history, 800 of whom rampaged through the capitol shitting on the floors and looking for political enemies to murder should be charges of treason.
The primary is still a few years away and the political winds can shift quickly. I think a lot depends on Biden's health and popularity leading up to the 2024 election. It is extremely difficult to unseat a sitting President unless they are massively unpopular, like Trump was. 

DeSantis is still relatively young, and he can run for another term as Governor. He might wait out until 2028 to run if a Republican victory looks like a longshot in 2024.
