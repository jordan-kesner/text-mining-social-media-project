Title: Starbucks is the latest company to say it will pause advertising on “all social media platforms” and promises to have discussions internally and with media partners and civil rights organizations to stop the spread of hate speech.

So in other words they’re temporarily reducing expenses to appear woke, and they’ll be getting free news coverage for doing so. It’s a sound business decision.
All these companies are cutting money from advertising anyway. Now they are just helping build brand image while doing so, so that it seems like a choice for social justice and not because they are bleeding money
I hate these companies who make a token effort so that they appear 'woke' to their customers. Starbucks and Coca Cola have both announced they're pausing advertising, even though all they're doing is reducing advertising costs at a time when they probably need to do so because of reduced revenue.

That's before we even mention that they're two of the biggest culprits for environmental waste in a time when climate change is also of critical importance.
Starbucks needs to remove their Facebook page. Having a Facebook page is still using the platform for advertising, even if they aren't paying for it. It would show that they're actually dedicated to changing Facebook instead of just trying to save on advertising costs while looking "woke".
