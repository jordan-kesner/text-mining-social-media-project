Title: CMV: "White Privilege" and other social justice concepts aren't going to convince people who aren't already on board with the left. At worst, it will polarize the issue and inspire resentment.

Post:
I'm not dismissing the existence of white privilege, I just feel that it's a silly academic neologism for a reality almost no one disputes when you get down to it: That white people have it better off in everyday social interactions. The trouble is, people are inherently selfish and tribal. They have trouble understanding even members of their own kind. 

I won't dispute that deterministic, anti-meritocracy is a hard concept to sell to an inherently selfish humanity, but academics couldn't market the concept worse if they tried. People don't like hearing that they didn't earn or deserve everything they have, or that free will and individual grit sometimes isn't enough, especially from some uppity Jesse Jackson types that didn't get the memo that Jim Crow is over. Well, that's how it comes across to Conservatives, anyways. Nobody wants to acknowledge that they might be the problem, so they villainize the messenger and reinforce their own prejudices. Case in point: #GamerGate. 

All I'm saying is, maybe academics need a better approach. Not everybody sees life from a communitarian nurturing mother POV - especially in the United States. For example, there's a very good argument to be made that racism was not the primary cause of Michael Brown's death. Instead, it was his violent behavior in an altercation with a cop that caused the cop to retaliate with lethal force. Sure, race was no doubt a proximate cause and was probably a very distant cause for his circumstances, but his death was entirely avoidable if he didn't get so violent with the cop. Again, it all comes down to free will vs. determinism in issues like this. Sociologists and progressive types usually fall into the latter camp.

The famous ["Unpacking the invisible backpack"](https://www.isr.umich.edu/home/diversity/resources/white-privilege.pdf) analogy was the first exposure to the idea of privilege that I had. This analogy was written in 1989. I was taught about it in middle school.

You better believe I was resistant to the lesson about it in middle school when my teacher said, at least what sounded to me like: "okay kids, today we're going to learn how those of you who are white have it easier than everyone else and you're going to feel really guilty! Ready?"

I believe she actually brought a backpack or used one of ours as a demonstration as she pretended to pull things out of it. I remember this image and I remember it negatively. But I also remember it I think because it was a defining moment: I *got* it. The lesson worked on me. By the end of her pulling imaginary privilege out of the backpack, I understood how it's not my fault and it's not my actions: it's how other people perceive me and that makes my life that just easier than those perceived in a less positive light based on the way they look. 

This is a really roundabout way of saying: my anecdotal evidence disproves your CMV. I was responsive to learning about privilege in school even though I was resistant at the beginning of the lesson. Teaching about privilege worked on me.
So, I don't know how far this is going to go, and I'm mostly posting to see if someone can suss out how I feel about this, but I think one of the most ignored, but best examples of privilege is classicism.

I think one of the reasons it doesn't get discussed as much is because the people who are discussing privilege are not suffering from poverty. The people who are, might not be educated/aware enough about its existence to unite, and are more concerned with getting out of poverty.

But poverty is cyclical. Laws and political ideologies tend to favor the rich (who can buy their rights) and those within the demographics of the "disenfranchised poor" pay for the crime of poverty with freedom. Most studies I have read state that low income families have the highest number of child offenders, thus leading to becoming adult offenders.

The police target their neighborhoods, gangs provide the children with income and a purpose they don't have to achieve by society's standards, their schools do little to educate them or offer false hope, they are caught, fed into the meat grinder of the justice system, and they come out as worse offenders, or wind up dead.

They look to the gangs for protection, because the police automatically assume the worst. If their children go missing, they are assumed guilty by reason of poverty. Unable to afford child care, debts owing to a drug dealer, runaways due to a dysfunctional family life.

I haven't even scratched the surface, and I don't really know if I have any points that contradict yours, but I think sometimes racial motives are propelled by classist ones, and thus, the issues are really ignored.
[You're right that showing people evidence is a poor way to convince them of an argument.](http://news.bitofnews.com/the-scientific-way-to-win-an-argument/) However, people who have already made up their mind on racist issues aren't terribly helpful to a civil rights cause in the first place, and sometimes, the best you can hope for is that someone who is still on the fence will hear your argument and be swayed.

When dealing with racists, I tend to use the strategy outlined, just continually ask them to explain their views and watch as they get more and more moderate. But generally speaking, the utility for all these arguments is to sway the people who haven't dug in their feet and doubled down on their bigotry.
Subconscious biases are a useless claim anyway because they are unfalsifiable. If I were to call you racist, right now, say because you don't think white privilege was effective at convincing others, how would you defend yourself from that?

I propose instead that we take all accused subconscious racists, tie them up, and throw them in a lake. If they float they are guilty, if they sink they are innocent. 
Why do we insist on making a new name for something that already exists? Having the luck to be born into good circumstances has almost always just been called luck of the draw. Im not debating that I struck the jackpot by being born a white, middle-class male in the US. I would argue that marketing it that way would be more effective, because people dont want to be held responsible for the bad things done by their ancestors, but if someone is born into a wealthy family, most will say they deserve to be rich, even if they did nothing to earn it.

At the same time, it is next to impossible to be objective on things like this because our opinions are coloured by our experiences.
