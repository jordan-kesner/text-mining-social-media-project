Title: CMV: The ongoing Aimee Challenor drama is a good enough reason to leave reddit forever.

The tl;dr is that reddit's newest admin, a woman named Aimee Challenor, lived in the same house as her father while he raped and tortured a child over 10 days for which he was convicted, she was kicked out of some political parties for defending him and is currently married to a man who is openly pedophilic on the internet. Discussions about and criticism of Aimee and her being hired as an admin have been censored, edited by the admin team and users have been banned.

Aimee Challenor is disgusting person who should not have any authority at all over a website that is frequented by millions of children.

Reddit admins have demonstrated in the past that they are fine with pedophilia by leaving r/jailbait up for YEARS under the guise of free speech and only removing it after being pressured by the media. Hiring Aimee proves that nothing has changed in that respect. Reddit admins have abused their power in the past by censoring criticism and removing or even manually editing critical comments on T_D. u/spez promised that this abuse of power would never happen again. That was a lie.

Those are the facts. Here is the view I want to have changed: I should stop using reddit because continuing to do so means financially supporting some truly horrible people who protect child abusers and an admin team that openly attacks freedom of speech on their platform. The best thing I can do to combat the disgusting behavior of reddit admins is to take my internet traffic somewhere else.

Reddit isn't profitable and is still "focusing on expansion rather than immediate profits". 

While they have recently expanded the gold system, by adding additional awards, reddit basically doesn't have that many ads or make much money from ads (relative to other sites). 

So long as you don't buy gold, or wannabe gold, how exactly are you financially supporting reddit??
Reddit is an awesome platform with great communities. Instead of leaving, let's come together and demand Reddit changes and does better.
You had me until freedom of speech.

This is a private platform, and you are a guest until you leave.  The constitution doesn't apply here at all, they aren't the government and you are here voluntarily and you agreed to their terms and conditions for the privledge.  that's it, live with their terms and conditions or leave.

Yes they employ some thoroughly crappy people, but nearly every organization does.  You have the right to pick and choose which crappy people you will support.
You can leave reddit for any reason. 
But...staying on reddit isn't the same as financially supporting child abuse (just dont buy gold) or "attacks on freedom of speech."

Especially that last one. The fact that the reddit administration didn't personally descend to ban you for typing her name means clearly you are allowed to name her. That in addition to the fact that freedom of speech does not and never has existed as an inherent part of any platform except, maybe, parler, which advertises as being for that.
