Title: CMV: As a young white man in America, I feel worthless, disconnected from and hated by women/minorities, and – though I want equality – unwelcome in the conversation.

Post:
Hey, /r/changemyview –

I'm struggling. I'm struggling because, my whole life, I've wanted fairness and equality – but over the past year I've become bitter and lost. I want to help build a better world – but, because I'm white and male, I feel profoundly unwelcome in the conversation going on right now. Sometimes, I even feel scared by it. 

I don't need you to convince me that equality is important, or that inequalities still exist. (Of course they do.) Nor do I need to you to explain how, as a white dude, I'm privileged. (Believe me, I know.) But I am hoping you can help me see a better way forward than self-flagellation and guilt, which doesn't help me and certainly doesn't help anybody else. 

So, to unpack this stuff a little:

I feel worthless. Everywhere I look, I see articles about how terrible people who look like me are, and I feel ashamed. I feel guilty. I feel like I can't be proud of who I am – and I don't mean proud of my external characteristics (in the way that people sometimes say misguided stuff on here like, "Why can't we have a 'White Pride Day'?") but proud of who I am, deep down, as an individual person. It's hard because everywhere I look I see positive role models from other genders/races, and I want to be positive, too. But white men are pretty vilified and there's not a lot of examples on how I can be a decent person and actually help. The message I get is that I should just shut up and bask in my privilege, because society is done with me. Deep down, I'm a caring, emotional person and I'm buckling because I feel like I can't rise above the narrative in the media: that white people, men, and especially white men are just awful.

I think a part of me feels like I should suffer, because of my privilege.  So I read social justice news frequently.  But I'm exhausted – enough so that small things are starting to get to me. Today, for instance, I saw an article about whether or not "people of color" is an acceptable term to use and I kind of lost it internally – not because I don't care if the term is acceptable or not, but because I feel like I can't be this perfect white man who never offends anyone accidentally. There are so many angry articles I've read and I'd like to say that we could all be angry about the problem but it feels like we're angry at each other. And it's making it hard for me to see myself and others as individuals – the exact opposite of what I want. These days I walk around feeling like people hate me, scared that even if they're nice to me they're just thinking the same things these articles say.

It doesn't really feel like the narrative of equality today is, "let's build a better world together." It feels more like, "white men have caused all of these problems so you guys just go sit in a corner." And it makes me angry, because I want to help, and I don't believe that the best way for me to help is just go bask in my privilege and die. I want to say, I'm here for this, and I want to help, but you have to let me be an individual who is imperfect and not just "an evil white dude". 

Ugh. I know this is rambling and probably incoherent – the more I type, I'm getting emotional. 

Anyway, please try to change my view. I don't want to keep feeling shitty and wind up a bitter, Trump voter in 2020 (lol). I want to be part of this, and help, but I feel so unwelcome and lost. 

PS: I'm going to be here for the next few hours because I'm taking this seriously and will reply in good faith.

EDIT: Thanks for the productive conversation so far. I've got to step away for a little now but I'll check back in a few hours and reply some more.

Anyone, any race, any gender, whose self-worth and happiness are a function of their portrayal in the media, with an emphasis on negative depictions, will not like what we see.

You are very likely suffering from [mean world syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_world_syndrome) — the more news media one consumes, the more intimidating and threatening, the more *mean* they believe the world to be.

Women, black people, also never know when they are being judged on their race and/or gender. Any race, any gender, some people will hate you for being born. Fuck them. They are a small and sad percentage of humanity. 

But almost everyone is going to make stupid assumptions about you based on your appearance — it sucks, it’s part of being human, and we all have to deal with it.

I think you would be well served by consuming less media and having more human interaction. The world is not the terrible place you think it is. 
I don't think any one response here is going to change your view. What you've posted isn't a view so much as an entire mentality, and only by changing the things you do and think can *you* change this mentality for yourself.

Acknowledging the reality of systemic inequality is all well and good, but it seems like you've already internalized the concept well past the point where it's of any use to you. If you're going to continue researching the topic, I suggest you look into actual sociological scholarship, not inflammatory activist blogs or Internet memes.

I'll be blunt: *you need to stop reading "social justice news."* I'll even make a left-wing case for it: you belong to some privileged groups in our society, and your influence as a member these groups would be best used fighting for change. Any serious activist will emphasize the importance of self-care; don't get so deep into the cause that your mental health takes a blow. As of right now, these articles are negatively affecting your mental health and thus your ability to actually improve the world.

Which is the better version of you, one who knows about systemic inequality and does what he can to combat it but doesn't spend much time reading about it on the Internet, or one who reads Everyday Feminism on a daily basis and sinks deeper and deeper into self-loathing? The world needs empathetic folks such as yourself to help push for change. That spurious obligation to "suffer, because of [your] privilege" can go die in a fire.

Also, look around you. After spending some time distancing yourself from these gosh-darn articles, it should become apparent to you that your friends are your friends because they enjoy your company. If they thought the things said in the articles, they wouldn't associate with you. On the off-chance they're so unempathetic that they'd mock these feelings of yours, then are they really your friends in the first place? 
Well, I disagree with your notion that white men are broadly villified in the society; they're still the majority of the iconic figures in culture, science, world politics, etc.

However, this post is a perfect example of how the left wing - with all the "Nazi", "sexist", "racist", "bigot", "deplorable" labels pinned onto everyone who dares to disagree with their groupthink - is really a cause of the right-wing surge.

Smarter people like OP reflect and do not hesitate to discuss their thoughts and concerns. Others, especially those who, like teenagers, are generally prone to the protest mentality, just go: "Well yeah, the society calls me Nazi anyway for having moderate views? Then why bother, I might as well shift to the radical right". It's basically the same social mechanism as with some young Muslims in Europe who are having to deal with an unwelcoming environment, feel alienated and excluded, and therefore radicalize and join extremist circles. If everyone thinks of you as a potential terrorist and you simply cannot convince them they're wrong, it's much more likely that you become one. The HuffPost/Buzzfeed/Guardian Left therefore makes exactly the same mistake it accuses its opponents of, making a scapegoat out of a social group, using labels for it, alienating it. These lefties are the direct fathers of the monster that is the "alt-right" movement.

A Muslim is never going to be "correct" enough for a nationalist. Similarly, you are never going to be "correct" enough for this strain of the Left - whatever you do, you will find articles bashing your behavior. So yeah, stop reading their outlets completely. You don't need to read that stuff in order to champion for actual equality of rights and freedoms. Live your own life and, if someone labels you with one of the words I mentioned, don't go digging into yourself thinking what you did wrong; because for some, you will *always* be wrong no matter what.
I'm a white, straight, cis guy who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, so I sympathize with your feelings here. I'm pretty left leaning myself, and I'm very interested in creative and technical endeavors. I'm a game developer, so I think about applying diversity to my field or my work a lot. I haven't struggled with issues of guilt or self-worth, but I have struggled with wanting to correctly portray certain voices in works I create without misrepresenting anyone or erasing the voices of those who are already underrepresented. This was a bit of a tangent from my thoughts on this subject, but I just wanted to bring this up to show you that I get where you're coming from. I don't think you're crazy for feeling some internal struggle here.

I think the way I tend to think about this is that intersectional feminism is not a monolithic set of beliefs with some very easy to define world view. That may seem obvious, but I feel like it's worth talking about. It's very easy to believe that every single liberal agrees that all white straight cis boys are, at best, hapless perpetrators of their inescapable privilege or, at worst, neo nazis that worship white power. This is not true. This belief paints the simplest, most general picture of the western world, but it doesn't get into any real depth about what privilege actually is or what actions we should take to progress society positively.

I don't want to belabor the point too much, but I think some feminists tend to conflate trends or systematic failings with personal failings. For example, it's fairly well-established that white people in western society tend to benefit from systems that undermine the success and well-being of non-white people. These systems are racist and discriminatory. The logical leap comes in when someone thinks that this makes any individual white person racist and discriminatory. That's a vast oversimplification of a pretty general societal trend. 

I don't think that all feminists are like this. I think a tiny minority of them are sometimes, but the simplest beliefs of the loudest ones are the most visible. Most people who identify as feminist don't think you're worthless, and the people who think that about you are wrong. Your only responsibility should be to be chill and to think about how your actions affect others.
One thing I think you need to keep in mind is that you are not 'people like you'. You're simply 'you'. There's nothing you can do to change 'people like you', but 'you' change the moment you choose to.

Your problem isn't with feminism, your problem is with you. Everything you say demonstrates critically low self-esteem which is culminating in your need to validate yourself to others. Further, you demonstrate the socially-anxious behavior of judging yourself based on what you think other people think, which is a nightmarish rabbithole of taking everything you hear out of context (I'm incredibly guilty of this).

 You're going to go insane if you don't adopt a few premises for your life:

* You cannot be held to a higher standard than anyone else in the world. Anyone who insists otherwise of you is a hypocrite.

* The people who talk the most (i.e. content producers) rarely acknowledge nuance, and often know jack-shit about what they're talking about. If you listen to every person and take their word as gospel, you're going to feel confused and misled. You'll receive contradicting demands, bend over backwards to fulfill them both, and the people giving them will only find another reason to criticize you. This is how the average person works, often wholly unintentionally.

* No one is watching out for you except you. I swear. Not mom or dad or santa or anyone has your best interests in mind except you. That doesn't mean they don't care or have concern, but those are not the same as making you their first priority. If you don't start objectively looking at your physical/emotional needs and and working to fulfill them, no one is going to, and you'll be a whipping boy with no one to blame for yourself.

And on the subject of building a better world, I agree entirely. But three more points for you:

* Talk is cheap. Have something to show for it or don't mention it.

* Daydream alone. Don't bring people in on your plans, because people will naturally co-opt your plans and undermine the parts that don't fit their vision of what should or can be done. They don't mean to, but this is what they do.

* Remember that the world will default to doubting you until you prove them wrong. And even then, half of them will cross their arms and turn up their noses at you.

If all this sounds really pessimistic, it's because you and I are wounded idealists. If everyone was as well-intentioned as we are, the world would already be a better place. But you and I have gone about assuming that everyone shares our integrity, and so we take them at face value when they arbitrarily criticize us.

So stop. Don't let them do that to you any more. You know better than to be a door mat, so stop acting like one.

-- one man's opinion.
Unplug for a while dude. Your view sounds like its straight from the worthless internet echo chamber. Go volunteer for some community thing, whatever it is, youll see how together we all actually are.
I think you're putting far more thought into your own status as a white person than other people are. When you are asked to acknowledge privilege or past injustices, the point is not for you to be ashamed of yourself, nobody is asking that of you. The point is to recognize why things are the way they are and to recognize that people have had experiences that you may not be able to fully understand.

If you want a guide on how white people are supposed to assist social justice, this is from the [first result of googling.] (http://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/kivel3.pdf) You'll notice that be ashamed of yourself or shame other white people is not being asked of you. In fact one of the basic tactics listed is "Learn something about the history of white people who
have worked for racial justice. There is a long history of
white people who have fought for racial justice. Their stories
can inspire and sustain you."

And finally, I'm willing to bet that a lot of the articles you read might have a lot of anger behind them either because they want clicks, they're venting after something that they have experienced a lot, or a combination of the two. I don't think you can or should expect that anger to come at you simply for existing. 

And if you do cause race-based offense, just treat it like you would any other offense. Apologize for offending and if you need to understand why they're hurt ask about it politely. They can either except you apology or not, but you can't control that, you can only control being the best person you can be.
Pride. Dignity. Self-respect.

These are not things others give to you. (And as you wisely pointed out, things like "Why can't we have a 'White Pride Day'? are misguided and quite frankly a cynical attempt to exploit your desire for respect.)

You forge your own.

Do the right thing, regardless what anybody thinks. If others criticize your behaviour or actions or opinions, consider the criticism carefully, but who they are does not give them final authority over right and wrong. Others know their experiences better than you ever will, just as you will know your own experiences better than anyone else, but this does not make you incapable of understanding them or make them incapable of understanding you.

>*Homo sum: humani nil a me alienum puto.*

>I am human, I consider nothing human alien to me.

>-Terence

Do the right thing. Let empathy be your guide and teacher, not your master. If you believe social justice is in any way unjust, be the example of justice you seek.

For example, I don't agree with much of the social justice discourse (Seriously, white privilege? Maybe if you considered using a different term you wouldn't have to preface every definition with: "White privilege doesn't mean you don't deserve the nice things".), but I recognize they are hurting and yearning for the very same things I am which is why I don't *attack* them or anybody else in social justice communities that do or say things I don't like or agree with. Instead I focus on promoting my own brand of justice that shares many of the same end goals without the same means.

You could very well disagree with me, just as they could disagree with me. But my self-respect is not contingent on the approval of others.
I'm an old white guy, but I don't feel that way at all. Maybe it's because the older you get, the less of a fuck you give about what people think. Or maybe it's because for most of my life, white guys were the shizzle (do people still say that?). Or maybe it's because I live in Dallas, Texas.

The company I work for was started by a middle aged white guy. Then it was bought by a company headed up by a white guy older than me. Meanwhile the people I work with are mostly younger than me, but there are a few around my age.

It's a fairly diverse workforce, with plenty of white people, it seems like they're all doing okay, even the men. Leadership positions are diverse, with some white men and women, some non-white men and women.

Recently I did some block walking for candidates for local office. The organizer was a young white man. One of my walking mates was a young Hispanic woman. She walked with me twice, so I'm pretty sure she wasn't put off by my old white maleness. 

At the victory party I was one of the oldest people there. I met the parents of the candidate, they were a little older than me, but not much. 

There are so many variables, I couldn't possibly say you're wrong to feel the way you do, just relating my experience so you'll know it's not the same all over. 

One thing I will say though, it's a constant struggle for me to _not_ feel that I am the standard human. For years, everywhere you looked in advertising, movies, tv, and other popular culture, white males were nearly always at the center of the story, and all around the periphery too. I have to work at not feeling that way about myself, but it's liberating when I achieve it. Living in a big city it's easier to feel like just another ethnicity.
