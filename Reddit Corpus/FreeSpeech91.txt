So Trump's social media platform - are you telling me if people start brigading it with anti-Trump, anti-conservative rhetoric - they'll let that stand? Because their terms of service says they have the right to remove it. How is that not censorship, but YouTube is?
It is pretty funny seeing as he has his own web site at https://randpaul.com/ where he can say anything he wants.
Don’t more people point out the irony that he’s using mass media to point out that he’s being silenced on mass media?
It isn’t censorship, I can’t go on Fox News and say that Rand Paul is an animatronic robot built by satan sent here to drive people away from God’s holy YouTube, they won’t let me.
Can someone explain how the 1st Amendment protects freedom of speech from Big Tech?

It’s been awhile, but gosh golly I could have sworn my civics teacher told us it only protected us from the federal government (and eventually the state governments as well!) and did nothing for us against private companies. 

Or are we now looking to nationalize companies that we don’t like just like China does?
I mean...he's right. Conservatives should stop relying on government to force governments to cater to them. He's making a libertarian point and getting shit on in r/Libertarian for it?
I do hope the free market will come through and start breaking up big tech's monopolies but I have my doubts. Let's see what happens.
