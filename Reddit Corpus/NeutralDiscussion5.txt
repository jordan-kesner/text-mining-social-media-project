Title: [META] Housekeeping time! We're looking for new moderators. Also, a few notes on the state of the subreddit.

Post:
Hi all,

We're finally on the other side of the 2020 Presidential elections. It's been a busy couple months on the subreddit and users and mods alike can breath a sigh of relief knowing that we've seen roughly a 50% drop in traffic over the past month (which is typical following a presidential election).

With a bit of a lull, we thought it would be a good time to recalibrate and do a little light housekeeping.

First of all, I'd like to thank the subscribers for continuing to make this a great community for discussion. Maintaining a large, online, anonymous political discussion forum during extremely contentious times is extremely difficult, full stop. Given those inherent challenges, I'm consistently impressed with the thoughtfulness and quality of much of the content here and a lot of the credit goes to the userbase. 

I also want to give a huge thanks to /u/The_Egalitarian for their tremendous moderation work over the past few months. They've done a staggering amount of work on behalf of the community. Moderating can be somewhat grueling work, especially during the build up to an election, and Egalitarian has taken on the brunt of that work.  Thank you also to the rest of the other moderators who have helped keep the machine running. (I'm a back bencher so I feel comfortable praising the mod team.) In that vein, at the bottom of this post will be a moderator application. I encourage folks who are interested to apply.

Moving past the rainbows and butterflies, we know there are plenty of issues that persist and so I'd like to hone in on what I view as the major one.

**Quality and Tone of Content**

There continue to be issues with low investment content and incivility. The two biggest contributors to this issue, in my opinion, are largely external. First, when I joined the subreddit 4 years ago, we had 82k users. We now have more than 1.1 million. When the user base grows that substantially, the nature of discussion will change. Second, the American political environment has become extraordinarily divisive and totalizing, which is also reflected in this community. Those issues are layered onto the fact that running a constructive anonymous online forum is difficult in the first place.

As moderators, we've tried to make changes to the subreddit to adapt to these changes. We've created a casual questions thread, switched from an "approved-by-default" to "removed-by-default" method, revised our rules, and even restricted access from new accounts in the lead-up to the election.

Unfortunately, I don't think those actions and the others we've taken have done enough to compensate for the larger meta-issues noted above. Despite the overall impressive level of quality in the subreddit, I agree with the feedback we've been hearing from users that there has been some degree of deterioration over the past several years.

But we can improve and we will continue to strive to make this a place for constructive discussion where a range of opinions can be talked through constructively. We do need your help, though. To that end:

* **Your individual actions make a difference** - this is just a huge thing I want to highlight off the bat. Although the subreddit is large, your individual actions can have an outsize impact. Creating a new submission that opens up a substantive avenue of discussion, for example, can create space for hundreds of meaningful exchanges. Refraining from making snide remarks, flushing out your thoughts, being generous in your readings of other users' comments (I fail at this frequently) - they actually do make a difference. Please keep this in mind.

* **Echo chamber** - I think it's clear that this subreddit (and reddit as a whole) has a strong left-leaning bias. That's not inherently problematic, but becomes so when lower quality content aligned with the political opinions of the userbase is elevated and higher quality content cutting against the grain is quieted. Please be generous with other users even when you disagree with the views they express. Downvote sparingly, if at all, and make sure you're not downvoting on the basis of disagreement. Conversely, don't upvote just on the matter of agreement.

* **Low investment content** - don't post low investment content, including memes, jokes, short quips, standalone links, etc. If you see it, report it - and certainly don't upvote it. I think we as moderators can also do a better job enforcing our rules on low investment and uncivil content and we'll aim to do so.

[A reminder for everyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4479er/rules_explanations_and_reminders/). This is a subreddit for genuine discussion:

* Please keep it civil. Report rulebreaking comments for moderator review.
* Don't post low effort comments like joke threads, memes, slogans, or links without context.
* Help prevent this subreddit from becoming an echo chamber. Please don't downvote comments with which you disagree.

Violators will be fed to the bear.

Unfortunately I don't have the capacity to be a mod right now, but just want to say thank you to you all for your hard work. This sub has some of the highest quality discussion I see on reddit, and I imagine it takes a lot of work to keep it that way. It is much appreciated.
Appreciate all the work to keep this sub such a great place for discussion.

Unfortunately I don't think there's any way to avoid having a strong left-leaning bias in a sub focused on civility and genuine discussion. But I greatly appreciate that this isn't just a meme subreddit like r/politics has become.
I want to ask people what brings them here over other places on reddit?

You have a variety of places available, from the partisan subreddits, to the strict on quality r/neutralpolitics, to places like r/changemyview, or the AskA(politicalpersuasion) subs.

So why here?

I'm a Democratic Socialist/Socialist, so I'm far from being on the right wing, but I can't stress how important this is. The political atmosphere over the last 4 years has really pushed the standard/moderate/intellectual conservative out of the conversation, and I think it's valuable to have the discussion from that viewpoint, even if we disagree.

I know a lot of reasonable conservatives irl who no longer have a voice because the extreme right shouts them down as "snowflakes" or "deep state", while we on the left either ignore them or marginalize them.
Strong left leaning bias. 

This is a problem, as it is in other subs. Acknowledging and just kind of chuckling about it and playground requests won't fix it.
The one suggestion I would have is being stricter on left leaning posters who violate the civility policy.

On r/politics it's pretty clear right leaning posters who even come close to the line are banned while left leaning posters are often allowed to cross the line completely and dance with impunity.

Obviously it isn't anywhere near as bad as r/politics but left leaning posters do seem to get away with more than right leaning posters can
Mods really need to be better at removing posts that are arguing in bad faith ( happens all the time) and all the strawman posts. Happens all the time and it's so infuriating that it almost turns me off from the sub as much as the ridiculous left wing bias.
I haven't been here that long, so I havent' been able to observe the decline; but it seems very plausible.  A tricky problem to solve indeed; hopefully these measures will help with it.  Extraordinary situations also make it very hard for balance, due to the inherent tensions between the different kinds of balance (ie allowing all sides to speak while avoiding golden mean fallacies and such)

I wouldn't be wanted as a mod, I'm quite sure of that; my standards are quite harsh, and I'm not neutral.
I joined earlier this year and thoroughly enjoy reading this sub. As a Georgian, I’m extra appreciative of the steps you’re taking leading up to our senate runoff. Happy holidays, mods! Thanks for the work you do
