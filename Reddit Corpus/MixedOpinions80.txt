Title: CMV: People who have been wrongfully imprisoned should automatically be compensated for their time in prison to such an extent that they can live a comfortable lifestyle.

Post:
The main focus of my stance is people who have served long sentences for serious crimes such as those wrongfully convicted of murder or rape and released decades after their conviction although I would also support some form of compensation for lesser sentences for lesser crimes.  But the main focus of this CMV should be those convicted of major crimes such as murder who have spent many years in prison before their release.

One concept we have in American justice is the idea that someone who is sent to prison is "paying their debt to society".  The premise behind this is that a crime causes harm to society to a whole and having the criminal give up his or her quality of life for some time balance the scales.  If said person faced the same punishment without having owned that debt then the reverse must be true, society owes them a debt.  Since it is impossible to give them extra years on their life, the next best thing is to make the remaining years they have left as good as possible and financial compensation is the best way to do that.

The job market can be hard enough for anyone, let alone someone with a huge gap in their employment history.  Even if it is understood that the conviction was reversed there may be some employers who may be prejudiced against that person, maybe they feel that it's possible that they actually were guilty and don't want to hire them.  Even without such prejudice, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which a person with 15 years of experience would not get a job over someone who had 15 years of no job experience because they were in prison, save for an employer wanting to be charitable.  

Finally there is the concept of time away from "life".  Think about the things that you enjoy, that make life worth living.  Whether that be time with friends, family, travelling, going to concerts, or simply taking a walk outside, imagine having years taken from your life where you couldn't do these things.  Most people spend a large portion of their waking hours working to sustain a lifestyle of these things in their free time.  I spend time away from my wife at work, so that the time I do get to spend with her after work and on weekends is enjoyable and that we have necessities such as food and shelter.  Someone who has been wrongfully imprisoned shouldn't have to spend their time doing anything other than trying to make up for lost time.  They should be able to spend every day with their family and friends and just relaxing, doing things most of us hope to do in retirement.

But maybe there's something I missed, if you feel differently, see if you can change my view.

While a commendable view, this creates an issue of perverse incentives. 

As it stands - the justice system is encouraged to incarcerate the guilty and release the innocent. If an error is found, and can be proved in court, it is in the interest of the state to release the innocent. Jailing someone costs $. 

However, by compensating released individuals, you have created a reason for the state to NOT release innocent individuals. It may well be in the state's financial interest to keep them incarcerated rather than pay your proposed fee. 

This results, in DAs fighting to keep innocent people in jail, rather than incentivizing DAs to release people who are innocent. 

Edit: Given the large # of responses to this, I will try to respond here, rather than to you all individually. 

There is more to life than economic incentives. There are moral incentives, there are social incentives, there are psychological needs, etc. The point I was originally attempting to make goes something like this. 

1) Governments run smoothly when moral incentives and economic incentives align. 

2) Currently, moral incentives and economic incentives are aligned. Incarcerating the guilty and releasing the innocent makes sense both morally and economically. Yes, there are personal incentives (such as: that case really make my career, therefore I personally don't want to reverse my position) so the current system isn't perfect, but at least the moral and economic incentives were aligned, even if occasional personal incentives did not. 

3) Introducing OPs proposed payment changes this. Now the moral incentive to incarcerate the guilty and release the innocent is opposed by the economic incentive to not release anyone once they are incarcerated, guilty or not. This isn't to say all Court officials have no heart, and wouldn't follow the moral road - but things do tend to run much more smoothly when moral incentives and economic incentives align rather than collide. I've heard people mention payments approximately equal the cost in incarcerating. This produces skew incentives - moral incentives which aren't linked to economic incentives. Skew incentives are better than opposing incentives - but aligned incentives are better than skew incentives. 

4) Therefore, it is better to leave things as they are, rather than introduce OPs proposed payments. 

Or phrased much shorter - People follow the money, people also tend to me moral. When the moral thing, is also the economic thing, there tends to be high compliance. When the moral thing and the economic thing counteract, people are less likely to do the moral thing, relative to when the moral thing and the economic thing coincided. This isn't to say that people aren't moral, but acknowledges it is easier to do the moral thing, when it is also in your economic interest to do so, relative to when doing the moral thing is economically costly. 
Kansas just passed law for 60k a year if verdict overturned. My Missouri sucks as it will only pay out if there is DNA evidence proving your innocence. Been locked up 20 yrs and someone comes forward and admits it was them, gives specific details? They'll let you go but sorry no money for you
Some states already have a compensation plan in place for exonerated prisoners.

Texas, for example, has increased the wrongful conviction lump sum payment and monthly annuity of up to $80,000 per year of imprisonment. These prisoners that are released are eligible for up to $80,000 per year of imprisonment in a lump sum payment plus an additional monthly annuity of up to $80,000 per year of imprisonment. According to the Texas Tribune, Texas has “the most generous compensation law in the nation.”

What is "relatively comfortable"? You can't buy all the people who look at you as prison garbage. Turn you down for a job because of a background check. You can't buy back YEARS of missed birthdays, sporting events, anniversaries, marriage, having children, watching kids grow up, going to your own mother's funeral. Sitting in a jail cell year after year. Getting beat up or worse in jail. Seeing life pass you by on the other side  of a fenced in prison yard. Somethings just can't be bought with money.
I don't know if I remember this correctly but people who got wrongly convicted of major crimes and served a long sentence for it do actually get a big compensation for it. 
Personal-ish story about how money in a situation like this doesn’t make anything better.

My dad had a friend who’s wife was murdered. They accused him of doing it and he spent two years in jail. Despite the fact that he had a solid alibi. They ended up catching the men who actually murdered her, and released him. He sued the county and won somewhere between 1-2 million dollars. In the 70s. 

He lost his boat which was also his job, his business and connections, his wife obviously, his children, his home. Not even that much money could bring any of those things back. Sure, he could buy a new boat and a new house, but that doesn’t really make any of it better. Life as he knew it was over and ruined. He couldn’t cope, ended up doing a lot of drugs, and died a few years later.
When talking about prison, you must understand the overall goal these prisons carry. America has 5% of the worlds population but 25% of the worlds prisoners. Those who are wrongfully imprisoned often receive little to no compensation and are often forced to plea guilty in hope of a shorter sentence. America’s prisons have turned into capital gain, and the war on drugs provides a steady workforce of minorities. 
They should be paid an average years salary for each year they were in prison so it can be as if they had been working a middle class job the whole time, except they’d have all of it since they hadn’t been spending anything.
