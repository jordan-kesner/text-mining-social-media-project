There was an article a few years ago abt how facebook did the same.

And the moderators were forced to watch horrible stuff all day long. 
The mental health of the workers deteriorated immensely. Becoming more racist, more violent, more self destructive.

Training AI to do this type of stuff should be a priority. But because the people being harmed are just poors, it isn't
It would be better for everyone to just delete TikTok and the infinity scroll altogether.

Social Media was a fucking mistake
This sucks and all, but honestly, I'm trying to figure out who the hell in their right mind would even TRY to post suicide videos on Tik Tok knowing damn well it's a moderated platform. Like come on
