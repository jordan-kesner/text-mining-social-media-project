Title: Any Attempt at Political Censorship is an Admission of Having Lost the Debate

Post:
The basic fact of the matter is that as soon as you even suggest political censorship, you have admitted that you have lost the battle of ideas. It is a brutal authoritarian measure that is only used when a regime is backed up against the wall, and can no longer justify its own existence. It is really as simple as that.

The straightforwardness of this reality leads to those who censor political speech jumping through all different sorts of illogical hoops, traversing all manner of irrational mazes to try and justify their acts, apparently to the end of making the situation as confusing as possible so as to distract from the obviously desperate nature of the censorship act.

 Legislating political speech based on the concept that someone is able to control another person’s actions by sharing ideas with them would necessarily, if taken to its logical conclusion, lead to a total shutdown on all forms of political speech.

And that is the case with all of these arguments – if taken to their logical conclusion, no one would ever be able to say anything.The entire history of the Western legal tradition is based on people being responsible for their own actions. If we decided to remove that standard, and make the claim that people who talk to other people are responsible for their actions, then we would have a situation where entire groups of people are responsible for the actions of people they do not even know whenever anyone does anything.
