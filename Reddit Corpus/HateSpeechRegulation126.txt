Our schools were shut down by order of the Governor last Friday (Wisconsin), and people on my fb are saying the community needs to get the kids together for activities while they are out of school. While I understand the sentiment, isn't the reason for closing the schools to not have the kids in large groups?
Listening to a radio talk show--head of some restaurant association was talking about supporting neighborhoods by going out to eat.

&#x200B;

The governor of Massachusetts interrupted the show with a live update telling people not to go out to eat: restaurants are to offer take out only.
At a certain point social distancing is not going to work without a comprehensive social safety net which the US doesn't have.

I understand that this virus is bad. I also understand how stupid it is to call it a "bad cold" or downplay it.

However the United States is not ready for months upon months of isolation and bans/closures. At a certain point people facing complete and total economic ruin will be like "Fuck it. I don't want to live on the streets." And return to work.

I think it's interesting to see how this plays out. Not only from a viewpoint of the epidemiology but from the long term societal effects. How do you deal with entire generations of school aged children being a year behind? How do you deal with millions of people unemployed literally overnight?
Interesting tactic from a local restaurant... they're doing phone orders + Venmo only. No one allowed inside the restaurant and nothing trades hands between the store and the customer.

You call, place your order, Venmo them the money, and show up 15 minutes later. They meet you outside the door, hand you a bag, and you leave.
I was just thinking that we’ll probably be talking about September 11th level conspiracies theories around this thing for the next twenty years.
Where I work at has about 10,000 employees. About 80% of the work force was sent to work from home as of today. Poor IT on skeleton crew is trying to answer probably 5,000  calls about setting up Remote Desktop. Let’s hear it for the suffering IT people! We need you so badly right now.
NYC ordering all nightclubs and theaters closed and restaurants will only be allowed to do takeout and delivery. Great move for sure, but still freaks me out a bit, especially being a GM of a restaurant just 2 states away.
