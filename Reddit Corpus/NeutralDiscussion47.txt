Title: Unite The Right Rally Organizers must pay $25 million dollars to the plaintiffs in Charlottesville Rally injury. Will this dissuade the Alt Right type groups from organizing similar potentially violent rallies? Can this have an impact on social justice rallies that sometimes get out of hand?

Post:
The numerous finding of liability is based on Virginia state statutes on multiple counts for conspiracy; seeking compensatory and punitive damages.  Liability was found on all state counts, but deadlocked on two federal conspiracy count charges over whether organizers conspired to commit racially motivated violence or whether they had knowledge of it and failed to prevent it \[under Federal civil statute known as the KKK Act.\]

The nonprofit Integrity First for America backed the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.  Plaintiffs are nine current and former Charlottesville residents who were injured during the rally. 

 Almost half of the damages awarded by the jury was against Fields \[driver that ran his car into crowd\], Kessler, an organizer, white supremacists Spencer, Anglin, Heimbach and some others. 

 Lawyers for the plaintiffs had a stated goal \[among others\] to diminish the ability of white supremacists to spread their message and influence by draining them financially.

 Spencer, the Alt Right leader who represented himself called the trial a “weapon against free speech.” 

The NAACP Legal Defense Fund issued a statement thanking the nonprofit Integrity First for America for representing the plaintiffs.

Is there a danger now for some nonviolent groups that rally for social justice, which has been occasionally known to get out of hand, though violence has never been their stated purpose?

This case in no way impacts non-violent groups, nor does it hold groups liable where violence occurs spontaneously. The case was about proving that the violence that happened at Charlottesville wasn't an accident, it was preplanned and the stated goal of these individuals in their group chats. If you organise a protest with the intention of committing violence, then you are responsible for that violence. This is not new law. This does not set some new precedent. This does not impact BLM or any social justice group as long as they aren't organising with the intention of initiating violence.
There is a history of these laws being used against the KKK.

If people could misuse these tools they already would be trying.
No, the alt right are ideologues. The thing about ideologues by definition, is that they can't be persuaded, they are self assured in their own righteousness. They are dogmatic, uncompromising and closed minded about the thing they are so damn adamant about.

That's not to say they can't change. Many have, but that must come from within, through introspection. No amount of logical argument or court cases is going to do it for them.

Because I think violence, threats and intimidation are getting *waaay* out of hand and we are living in an  emotionally charged and highly polarized political environment that only exacerbates that kind of behavior, I think bringing attention to [42 U.S. Code § 1985](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1985) isn't a bad thing.  

But could newfound public awareness of this old federal law mean that some protestors may now have to defend themselves in a civil lawsuit, even if violence has never been their stated purpose?  Sure.  The statue prohibits, not only force, but also intimidation or threat.  A burning cross was likely the kind of intimidation envisioned at the time this law was passed; today, intimidation or threat could take other forms.
They are using laws targeting the KKK, not some general "Anyone who organizes a protest can be in trouble" laws.

So no, I don't think there's a danger of it being used against other types of non-white supremacism events that turn deadly.
