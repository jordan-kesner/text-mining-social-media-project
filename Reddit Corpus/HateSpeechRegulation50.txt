Title: No Fact-Checking and More Hate Speech: Meta Goes MAGA | Mark Zuckerberg has fully adopted the language of his former right-wing critics about what constitutes censorship

Funny that he'd become one of the slightly lesser hated billionaire CEOs but chose to throw it all away on this hill.
lol they actively alley oop'd the presidency to Trump \*a solid decade ago\* by turning millions of adult brains into pudding via the most insane and hysterical right-wing nonsense imaginable
From the article:

>In a five-minute Instagram video, rocking his new curly hairdo and a $900,000 Gruebal Forsey watch, Zuckerberg announced a series of drastic policy changes that could open the floodgates of misinformation and hate speech on Facebook, Threads, and Instagram. His rationale parroted talking points that right-wing legislators, pundits, and Trump himself have been hammering for years. And Zuckerberg wasn’t coy about the timing, explicitly saying the new political regime was a factor in his thinking: “The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech,” he said in the video.

>In Zuckerberg’s telling, the main impetus for the change is the desire to boost “free expression.” Meta’s social networks had become too extreme in restricting the speech of users, he said, so the thrust of the changes—which included ending Meta’s multiyear partnerships with third-party fact-checking organizations and retreating from efforts to diminish the spread of hate speech—is to let freedom ring, even if it means “we’re gonna catch less bad stuff.”

>But the tell is in Zuckerberg’s nomenclature. He described his company’s (not completely successful) efforts to avoid promoting toxic content as “censorship.” He has now adopted the same bad-faith characterizations of his employees’ work that the political right did, which used it as a bludgeon to force Facebook to allow ultraconservatives to promote things like targeted harassment and intentional misinformation. In reality, Meta has every right to police its content in the way that it wants—“censorship” is something governments do, and private companies are simply exercising their own free speech rights by deciding what content is appropriate for their users and advertisers.

>Another indication that there’s a MAGA element to these changes is Zuckerberg’s announcement that he’s moving Meta’s trust and safety and content moderation teams from California to Texas. Once again, he said out loud that the reasons for the geographical move were political: “I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams.” Hello, Mark? This move simply anchors Meta’s content arbiters in a location with a potentially different bias. It’s also a conspicuous statement that Zuckerberg himself might consider California—Trump’s kryptonite—as a less savory place to work than deep-red Texas.

>Ironically, this is all happening at a moment when Meta has arguably succeeded in making improvements to its once-miserable record of taking down hate speech and other legal, but toxic, posts. In 2019, when I spent a day in one of the company’s content moderation offices, the beleaguered moderators working there told me that dealing with gray areas like hate speech was the one thing that AI could never do. But more recently, Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun revealed that generative AI tools had changed the game. “Five years ago, of all the hate speech that Facebook removed from the platform, about 20 to 25 percent was taken down preemptively by AI systems before anybody saw it,” he told me in an interview late in 2023. “Last year, it was 95 percent.”

>Now, Meta says it’s throwing that win into the dumpster. It will change the algorithm, and AI will no longer proactively block “lower severity” policy violations like hate speech and, presumably, bullying. (Meta says that it remains committed to vigilantly blocking “high severity” illegal content, like terrorism and child exploitation.) Meta also has made a series of changes to its speech policies permitting certain kinds of comments formerly deemed hateful. One of those hits a right-wing hot button—gender and sexual identity. For example, now it’s OK to allege that gay or transgender people are mentally ill or call them just plain weird on Facebook.

>The new Zuckerberg seems less concerned about the criticism that he knows will come of these moves—and he doesn’t even have to move to Texas to avoid it. There’s a sense of liberation in his short speech announcement, almost as if he was washing his hands of a decade-long content moderation controversy before turning back to his real passions of AI and mixed reality. He’s one person, at least, exulting in the joys of free expression.

Given the recent procession of big tech CEOs to kiss the proverbial ring of the incoming president, this kind of move is not incredibly surprising. That being said, the scrapping of these meagre safeguards on these platforms are going to present major problems worldwide to those who rely on them for communications. Misinformation has already been an issue with content moderation, and without it, it will proliferate even further and corrupt the ability of the public to discern reality from unreality.
What once was a wonderful dream of humanity coming together on social media, to this. 

You’re a piece of shit Zuck and the world will remember you as such.
Meta had fact checkers? Could have fooled me with my feed being 99.9% AI-generated BS for the past couple years.
All this means is the conservative bots radicalize more people. 

Imagine being so rich money doesn’t mean anything anymore and still being a raging fucking greedy ass coward. Your yachts have yachts and you still haven’t built a fucking library or anyhing that helps anyone else out like you’ll be able to eat your money when you’re sieged in your fucking bunker.

Like that money will buy you oxygen when they cover the vents to your underground layer.

Corny assholes.
'Mental characteristics, including but not limited to allegations of stupidity, intellectual capacity, and mental illness, and unsupported comparisons between PC groups on the basis of inherent intellectual capacity. We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like “weird.”'

This comes straight from their "Hateful Conduct" policies. This is a fucking joke. So pretty much because Republicans have been called "weird" we're now allowed to call members of the LGBTQ+ community mentally ill.
