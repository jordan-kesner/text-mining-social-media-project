Title: CMV: If Republicans do not support Abortion or Birth Control, then they should be supporting social programs to help families raise children.

Post:
I know that the topics of Abortion and Birth Control are very sensitive topics for people to discuss (especially here on this subreddit). But the main issue I see with these topics is what should be allowed for women to do if they cannot care for a child that may come about from having intercourse with someone. In Politics, as the issues have come up, Republicans have seemed to come to the conclusion that both Birth Control and Abortion are either immoral or a form of murder (I'm stating both because these are the most common arguments I see).

By themselves, I can understand these arguments, I mean I understand wanting to give babies a chance at life, but they also contradict with the fact that Conservatives also generally do not support social welfare programs in general but that opposition also includes not supporting initiatives to help families care for children. There are many different programs different countries have done, such as Maternity Leave, Healthcare reforms centered around birth care, subsidies to assist with childrearing cost, etc... These are usually government forms of assistance, but there is also intense opposition to private attempts to help families with these issues (Planned Parenthood is the first thing that comes to mind, but there are probably other good examples).

So TL:DR, what am I saying. I've noticed that Conservatives do not support Birth Control or Abortion, but also refuse to help cover the costs of the children that result from the lack of access to these, even when families cannot afford the children they are essentially forced to have.

I'd like to see some justification for this, or just some sort of explanation for why they should keep up this mess of contradictions in US politics.

**Edit: I'm just going to say this because its coming up alot in the comments below, what I am getting at is Republicans are generally against interfering with what a person does in their lives, but they seem to violate that in trying to restrict abortion. So I am saying that if they are willing to intefere in someones life because of that, they should be willing to help cover the costs associated with that prevention**

>Republicans have seemed to come to the conclusion that both Birth Control and Abortion are either immoral or a form of murder (I'm stating both because these are the most common arguments I see).

I think it's fair to say that a lot of Republicans are Pro-Life, but I want to note that **most** rational people support birth control. I think it's really only the fringe right that says no to a condom. 

>but also refuse to help cover the costs of the children that result from the lack of access to these, even when families cannot afford the children they are essentially forced to have.

Well, I think pro-life people truly believe that killing a baby when it's inside a womb is no different than murdering a person on the street. And although I'm more pro-choice, I can understand how someone might feel a moral obligation to prevent this from occurring... just as someone might step in to prevent a husband from stabbing his wife (etc). 

And say you bravely prevent that wife from being stabbed/killed as an act of moral duty; are you now on the hook to make sure the wife has a comfortable life because you saved her from dying? I don't think you necessarily are. 

Again, I think that's how pro-life people approach this whole thing. They are simply stepping in to prevent a murder from occurring because they believe it's their duty to protect those who can't protect themselves. 

Right or wrong, I can understand how that is a rational, and logical viewpoint.  

Republicans believe in individual liberty and empowerment. The belief that the unborn are human *necessitates* being against abortion.

I think social programs are fantastic, but the general Republican position is that you are an island. You are your own man. You own responsibility for your life and your family. If you want your kids to get a good education, you push them to do that. If you want your kids to have food, shelter, etc. *that's on you*. 

There isn't really a logical inconsistency in those beliefs, and as a result, there isn't a need for them to push for social programs under their worldview.
As aa conservative who is slowly crossing the aisle as I get older - I would add that they also should be making it easier to adopt kids in need.  Don't make willing parents who have passed the tests and checks pay tens of thousands of dollars, be put through the ringerx given no guarantees, and often lied to.  

There are a lot of families that want to adopt and help.  Let them.  Give the kids a chance.
You have to understand that most Republicans are against abortion not because they want to deny rights to women. Instead, they consider the unborn fetus a human, sometimes at conception. Therefore, abortion is murder.

They're not saying you must protect children in every way (including government programs). Many simply believe that abortion is murder because of their definition of what is considered life 
> I've noticed that Conservatives do not support Birth Control or Abortion

Religious fundamentalists are opposed to birth control. Every conservative I know, myself included, support the ability of a person to purchase and use birth control. We just don't support the state buying it for them.

Religious fundamentalists oppose birth control because they believe that sex is supposed to strengthen the marriage and produce children. That is why they are also opposed to non-procreative sex acts and premarital sex.

Not all Republicans are religious fundamentalists, and very few are so extreme they oppose the use of condoms even in the confines of a marriage.

As for abortion, the reason Republicans oppose it is simple: an abortion is the termination of the life of a human child. There's really no other way to put it. Whether you are for or against abortion the reality is the same. A human child must be eliminated - in some cases what we both would agree is killing a baby - in order for an abortion to be completed.

>  they also contradict with the fact that Conservatives also generally do not support social welfare programs

Conservatives don't support social welfare programs for two reasons. First, the responsibility is on you to provide the things you need. It is your responsibility to feed and clothe yourself and make sure your children are cared for. If you cannot do that then you should make the choice to not have children.

Secondly, it is inherently wrong and immoral to take money from someone against their will. By logical extension it is also wrong to force someone to pay money towards a social program.

> but there is also intense opposition to private attempts to help families with these issues

The only example you give is of Planned Parenthood. The point you're missing, though, is that the opposition to PP is due to the fact they perform abortions. They are, in fact, the nation's number one single provider of abortions. If they did not perform abortions then there would not be opposition to them by any but the most fringe groups. They were also partly subsidized by the government, which goes back to my earlier point about taking money from others. I do not oppose PP being able to privately perform abortions. I do oppose PP getting my tax dollars without any input from me.

> even when families cannot afford the children they are essentially forced to have.

No one is forcing families to have children. You have the option of birth control, adoption, abstinence, parenthood or abortion. The Republican argument is that abortion should not be an option.

> what I am getting at is Republicans are generally against interfering with what a person does in their lives, but they seem to violate that in trying to restrict abortion.

Because the Republican position is that aborting a baby is not a choice you are making solely for yourself; it's also an act of murder. It would be the equivalent of saying that a person should have a right to murder their spouse to end an unwanted marriage and because you the right to do what you want with your life. The Republican position is that you do not have a right to murder your spouse.

> they should be willing to help cover the costs associated with that prevention

Or you could just be willing to engage in responsible behavior and accept the consequences of irresponsible behavior. If you do not want to have a child, then put that child up for adoption. If you do not want to carry a child to term then use protection or abstain from sex. These aren't contradictory beliefs.
There are some falsehoods in here.  Firstly, the great majority of conservatives have no problem with birth control.  It's the responsible thing to do, and that's what's at issue here for me.  I have no problem with abortion, but you are responsible for your own actions.

If you get pregnant on accident, it's almost certainly because of some decision that you made.  Again, I have no problem with abortion, but the fact remains that you almost certainly got yourself into this position.  Therefore, it is YOUR responsibility to deal with it.  Not mine.  

I understand that the resulting child had no say in this, and that's why I'm personally not opposed to safety nets (nor are most conservatives, btw).  

You've used language here that misrepresents the actual conservative position.

I'm not opposed to birth control.  I'm not just not going to buy it for you.  Buy it yourself if you want to have sex and not end up pregnant. 

I'm not opposed to safety nets for children.  I just want them managed better and with strict requirements on how they're utilized.  

With those in mind, hopefully you can see that the idea here is not punishment or something.  It's you, a grown adult, taking ownership of your choices. 
You can think we should have laws banning murder (which hopefully, you do), while also thinking that we should not have a massive welfare state.

In other words, "it should be illegal to kill" does not require "everyone should have X provided for them." I think you make the mistake many pro-choice people make, in that you see "pro-life" and attach your own personal opinions on what that means. "Pro-life" is really about a belief that the unborn are living people with rights (alive), and that aborting your unborn child because it would make your life too difficult is morally identical to burying a pair of scissors in your newborn because it makes your life too difficult. 

As for birth control, I again think you fail to understand our position. Next to nobody wants to ban condoms or the pill. We just don't want our tax dollars paying for you to go out and have sex on our dime when we think sex outside of committed relationships/marriage is stupid, destructive, or wrong. It isn't inconsistent whatsoever.

I can say "you can't kill a homeless guy," and also say "I don't think we should have free housing," and have a totally consistent moral framework. You can oppose active harm to another AND oppose massive welfare programs at the same time.

For an example, I think it's wrong and should be illegal to steal a TV. I also would oppose a tax-subsidized program that gives free TVs to people on food stamps. 

I think it's wrong and should be illegal to rape. I also would oppose a tax-subsidized program where prostitutes give free sex to incels.

I think it's wrong and should be illegal to kill someone. I also would oppose welfare programs that pay for all of their needs cradle to grave.

Long story short, pro-lifers believe that the unborn are human beings that have the right to not be killed. The right to not be killed is completely independent from a welfare state. 

My question for you is if you think a parent has the right to kill their child up until they are legally adults. If you think they don't, do you think it's inconsistent to also think that you don't bear the responsibility of caring for the kid? If so, what is your requirement of care? Food? That's already covered. Shelter? Again, covered. Utilities too. So...what about education? Transportation? Entertainment? At what point, in your mind, do the beliefs that murder should be illegal and that welfare should provide become seperate? Wherever you draw that line, I bet money that I can quibble over the details and make you out to be an inconsistent monster that doesn't *really* care about kids. 

All we do is say "don't kill kids." That position doesn't mandate taxation to fund welfare. 

Here’s a dirty little secret: Republicans aren’t as opposed to abortion as they say they are, and, for that matter, Democrats aren’t as radically pro-choice as they claim, either.  

Abortion is a topic that has been captured by two extremes that are each not representative of the middle.  Bill Clinton came closest to the American consensus on abortion when he described a desire for it to be ‘safe, legal and rare.’  The broad middle of the country finds abortion distasteful, but not quite so distasteful that they want to take the option off the table.  They don’t see it as something to be proud of.  It’s not something to be celebrated.  They certainly don’t see it as a valid method of birth control, nor would most describe it as ‘health care’.  But at the same time, most people - including, I’m pretty sure, most evangelicals - want the option available, especially if it’s their own teen-aged daughter who happens to be knocked up.  We’re hypocrites; we think people should behave more responsibly, but we sure do want a reset button if we fuck up.  

That’s why both sides can claim majority support - it’s all down to how you ask the question.  Ask whether abortion should be legal at all, and you’ll get a pro-choice result, with a clear majority in favor.  Ask from the other end, about the legality of third-trimester or partial-birth abortions, and you’ll; get very different answers.  *And they’re both correct*.

This isn’t to say that abolitionists aren’t a thing.  There absolutely are people - mostly on the right, mostly Christian - who really do want abortion to be illegal under all circumstances.  They see it as a stark moral issue where abortion is the killing of a child.  Advocacy for that position creates a response among people who value agency for adult women as sacrosanct, and its driven them to positions just as radical as those on the right.  There really are people on the left who think a woman’s right to abortion goes right up to the moment of birth.  People on these extremes tend to be single-issue voters, or at least, to hold the wrong position on this issue to be disqualifying above others, and its these people who drive the ongoing dispute.  The big squishy middle, having made peace with the moral/ethical/practical compromise that is abortion, don’t care nearly so much.  They’re interested in other things, which means the people at the extremes dominate and continue to drive the debate.
