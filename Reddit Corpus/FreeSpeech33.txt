Title: Free speech on x?!?!

Post:
We have seen in the UK that people have been jailed for social media posts. Some may have just been emotional responses to what was going on at the time, who knows.
Now if I was running my state, I would encourage free speech, come on my platform say whatever you want, it is your right, reveal yourselves to me.
That way I could identify the crazies, monitor their movements and act when necessary to stifle their opinions.

The people who were gaolled were posting violent threats against innocent people.

That is illegal everywhere, even in The US.
I agree. Kinda feel like you dont have normal without crazy. You dont get to the truth without looking at what's false, etc...
