Title: How Antifa and BLM are fascists and hate free speech ! How did you become a fascist without even knowing it ! An honest and provocative piece about wokeness, US social problems and social "justice" turned injustice ! An overall post about facts without pol bias !

Post:
I think many americans are confusing issues and brainwashed by second grade articles on the internet , mass-media and social media to actually know what fascism is . So let me clarify some aspects ! 

**Fascists are not defined as being in a position of power** . If you think that you  are confusing history with a function and adjective .

Fascism was going on in the medieval ages , long before the second world war .. it's called religious fascism . Now we live in a time where fascism is done by the "anti-fascists" ironic or not . It's a simple character judgement of people involved with BLM and Antifa , both orgs are authoritarian and have fascist tendencies !

**Fascists can be anyone who adhere to a certain way of thinking and acting ! It's a form of authoritanism !**

*Fascist  - person who adheres to fascism !  \[2\] the philosophy, principles, or methods of fascism.*

Therefore , you can be a fascist and not be part of any political movement or structure !

*Now, let's check out Antifa and BLM :*

1.  **Fascism often involves a mass movement** \-  checked ! 
2. **Fascism is authoritarian** \- Both org. are dogmatic in their views and don't accept other opinions that contradict their own . They want to impose their will unto others and that makes them authoritarian - checked ! 
3. **Fascism is often violent** \- riots , verbal and physical violence towards those who don't share their views , harrasment of random people on the streets ,etc -  checked ! [https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/08/31/riots-violence-erupting-turning-many-away-blm-and-protests-column/5675343002/](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/08/31/riots-violence-erupting-turning-many-away-blm-and-protests-column/5675343002/)
4. **Fascism is radical** \- numerous facts about BLM promoting the superiority of the Black Race - checked ! Groups like Black Israelites , Black Panthers , "Black Power Movement " , all tied to BLM and Antifa **. In fact , the same logo used by the Black Power Movement , the black fist is the logo of BLM !** 
5. **Fascism is correlated with race superiority** \-  This relates to no. 4 ; **Question : How is described the White Power Movement ?** Unless you are so much of a hypocrite with double standards and *\[ racist \]* incidentably to tell me there are differences just because of skincolour , it's a rethoric question  - checked ! 

So , let me guess ..you thought only white supremacist have idiot race theories . You may want to check " **Melanin theory** " -  is a claim in Afrocentrism that a higher level of melanin , the primary determinant of skin color in humans, is the cause of an intellectual and physical superiority of black people and provides them with superior abilities or even supernatural ones .  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin_theory) 

*Oh , did I mentioned one of it's main promoters is Nick Cannon , the guy from America's Got Talent ?* 

6.   **Fascism is nationalistic** \- BLM came to existance on the same ground as the Black Power Movement during the Civil Rights Movement of 1960's . Robert Franklyn Williams, Malcom X ,  Kwame Ture, Bobby Seale and many others were, surprise... **nationalists** ! In fact , Malcom X is largely credited with the popularity of " Nation of Islam " wich was quite nationalistic as ideology . Moving forward ,many BLM members are openly promoting a *"Black State"* and *pan-africanism* !  - checked ! 

7**. Fascists will use any means necessary to achieve their goal** \- cheked !  

8. **Fascism is right-wing** \- You never hear this on tv, but what if I told you , BLM is actually  right-wing ? Let's delve deeper into the issue . What is right-wing anyway and how is it characterized ? 

a. *Right-wing is nationalistic*  \- pretty much covered that at point no. 6 ! 

b. *Right-wing has a racial identity and promotes a racial agenda* \- Do I really need to bother with hundreds of links...when you have TV and social media all around ? It's a no brainer you just need to replace "white" with "black" . If you still are brainwashed , check out  [Leonard Howell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Howell)  

c. *Right-wing is deeply religious* \- some of the BLM "elites" are pastors who promote BLM messages to their congregations ! In fact , a large percentage % of BLM followers are coped up by religious clergy or influencers ! The black comunity is deeply religious ! If you are going to stand here and tell me it's not , then check out the data and facts yourself ! 

In fact the Black Comunity is more religious than the white comunity by almost 10% as 79% of Black Americans are religious !

9. **Fascism hates freedom of speech** \- Most social platforms ( including this one ) are banning anyone who disagrees with the BLM dogma , *proof is in the pudding*.  Any doubt who seen US campuses recently ?

Here is a more broad view about the issue : [https://redflag.org.au/node/7276](https://redflag.org.au/node/7276)

 So , still think BLM and Antifa are not fascist ? Here is more data : 

Have you ever heard of Paxton ? He wrote a book called " *The Anatomy of Fascism* " , in wich he described how fascism works and what it is.  In his 1988 essay  "The Five Stages of Fascism" , he defined fascism core characteristics :

 

1. The primacy of the group. **Supporting the group feels more important than maintaining either individual or universal rights**.
2. **Believing that one's group is a victim**. This justifies any behavior against the group's enemies.
3. The belief that individualism and liberalism enable dangerous decadence and have a negative effect on the group.  
4. **A  strong sense of community or brotherhood**. This brotherhood's "unity and  purity are forged by common conviction, if possible, or by exclusionary  violence if necessary."
5. **Individual self-esteem is tied up in  the grandeur of the group**. Paxton called this an "enhanced sense of  identity and belonging."
6. Extreme support of a "natural" leader, who is always male. This results in one man taking on the role of national savior. 
7. "The  beauty of violence and of will, when they are devoted to the group's  success in a Darwinian struggle," Paxton wrote. **The idea of a naturally  superior group** or, especially in Hitler's case, biological racism, fits  into a fascist interpretation of Darwinism.

 **Any red flags now ?** Let me refresh your memory

T*he New Brown Shirts credo . Every Antifa and BLM member should know them ! Main core principles :*

1. **Emotions over facts !** Let your emotions be the facts ! " We belive in truth over facts " - Joe Biden 2020
2. **Using Violence to get what you want !**  \- Riots are good when they are done for our cause . You are justified to do any violence in the name of  the cause !
3. **Scream over the other person to make a point !**  \- Always judge people with preconceptions about them , if they are not  with you , then they are against you ! Let the other person know he is  wrong by imposing your own ideology , preferrably by shouting loud at  him or acting agressivly !
4. **Label everyone who doesn't agree with your views as "racist" " fascist" and "nazi"** . Use these words as often as you can to demolish any argument and debate !
5. **Promote a racial narrative and demonize white people !** \- Black people are always opressed , white people are always the agressor and opressor ! NEVER question this !

[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2008/racist-black-hebrew-israelites-becoming-more-militant](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2008/racist-black-hebrew-israelites-becoming-more-militant)

1. **Group mentality over individualism !** \- You belong to a group , what the group wants is paramount... don't ever question it and listen to our influencers !
2. **People are tied to their race and should be judged by this basis**  \- Everyone who strays from the norm will be ostracized, doxed and  harrased . If you can't do it in real life , then online and  cyberbullying will sufice !
3. **Use your race as a weapon** whenever you can to get out of a situation or win an argument !

One of the main core of BLM is racial pride ! *But yea , it's not at all racist ofc not ... !*  

[https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/black-power](https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/black-power)

1. **Always victimize yourself to get the attention**  needed to spread your narrative when in public ! - Mainstream media  will always be on your side , so make use of that to your advantage as  much as you can !
2. **Create a dystopian enviroment based on race and tribal mentality !** \- It all comes down to what "we" want ,other people's needs and opinions are irrelevant as long as we don't do what we wish !
3. **Call people ignorant** when you are in any sort of trouble to get your ideeas out and are confrunted with *so called "rationality"* !
4. **Everything you do for the cause is justified ! -** Don't let anything stand in your way to promote these ideeas whenever you can !

**Is it all worth it ?** 

*Fact - checking* :  864 people in 2020 have been killed by police : [https://killedbypolice.net/kbp2020/](https://killedbypolice.net/kbp2020/)

Some may say , one is too many . Of course, from those 864 people are included white people also and obvious criminals / justified shootings . But for the sake of argument , let's *ignore the facts* and say all of them were black people and they were all innocent . 

How many people are commiting crime in US , how many are black people ? 

2019 report : **2,667,010** black people been arrested for different crimes , including  **172,980 violent crimes ,  5,660 for  Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter done by black people** !

*Conclusion question :* 

**So how can a group ( BLM ) wich is deep knee and evolved around the phisosophy of Afro-Centrism be for equality when it's core principles are about superiority over others and nationalism ?**

**So, let us all say in hypocrisy : #BLACK POWER #BLACK \_MOVEMENT #BLM ...because there are so few real educated people anymore to challenge us !**  

**"**  ***The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists*** **"** \- *Winston Churchhill*

My personal conspiracy:

Remember when there was trolls and bots trying to effect election in 2016?

Well, China does not like US - Fact.

China has an army of internet trolls, 50 cent army - Fact.

They used that army to argue on behalf of China during Hong Kong take over - Fact.

Don't you think that China would use that army to fuck up and brainwash Americans?

China already pay for articles in American news media, wouldn't a troll army be cheaper? and they don't have to register as a foreign agent and could totally fake their identity as internet is anonymous. And the reach much bigger audience more effective. Just make memes about how shit the president is and how shit the America is.

Just post true but anti American sentiment to grow anti American sentiment. And bury anti Chinese sentiment. Tell people it's "racist".

* Simply just argue any argument that divides people and make them act out. Burn shit and fuck up economy. Does not matter what that opinion is, argue for and against. Do the most damage.

Make a subeddit or pretend to be from US and get onto moderators team. Slowly remove anybody arguing against Chinese interests. Be it free speech, Uighur, concentration camps or Nike investing in China etc.
They most certainly are. These people often are the worst offenders of projecting their faults and sins onto others.

The thing I find hilarious is they think themselves these grand revolutionaries yet they're completely propped up by the political/corporatist establishment. These fascist groups are pawns in a game that is about distracting common people from the fact the biggest wealth and power transfer is going on behind all of our backs.
Oh my I thought this was satire and then I read the comments and I am sad. This is entirely conjecture that is impressively coherent given the fact that it is absolute nonsense. I don’t even know where to start asking my questions good grief. “both orgs are authoritarian and have fascist tendencies !”  You literally start out by letting us know that you have no fucking clue what you’re talking about. Neither of these things are organization and how the fuck can something have fascist tendencies. It is or it isn’t. That’s it. 

   Ok I guess I’ll start with the fact that neither Antifa or BLM are organizations. I don’t know how you can suggest otherwise because they lack.... organization. They are movements and are both response movements. Neither Antifa nor BLM are ideals that just occur. If it were not for white supremacy groups, far right violence, and the fact that there is an actual wanna be fascist as a president (for a little while longer) then Antifa, the movement, would not exist in present day. Why would it? 

Do you know what else is a response group? All lives Matter. They don’t exist without BLM and if BLM never existed, neither would ALM. You think ALM is an organization too? It isn’t. 

If black people weren’t being killed by the same people who oppress them, then BLM wouldn’t exist? Do you take issue with saying they’re oppressed? I ask but I know that you do. Well chances are any alt right lunatic who would write this shit loves Ben Shapiro right? Well even he likes to remind people that black men commit 52% of murder but are only 13% of the population. So either black people are EXTREMELY fucking violent by nature, or there is currently systemic racism meant to keep black men locked up. Which one of those is true? One of them must be. If they were as violent as that would suggest, then why the fuck haven’t black people already succeeded or even attempted to forcibly rise to the absolute top of society and ruled with an iron fist? 
If they are authoritarian then why the fuck are white people not walking around as literal god damn slaves right now?  
Like seriously I can’t even wrap my head around the idea of someone writing this and thinking “wow this is some good shit.” Am being fucked with here? Is this taking the bait? 

The entire logic (I’m generously using that word) completely collapses on it self before you even explain why you’re right. 

How the fuck could someone actually think that either of these things are fascists and are authoritarian that makes no sense. At all. You interestingly make a point to note that you can be a fascist and structure isn’t necessary which seems like a very odd specification to make. Like you actually do know that Fascism has a very very clear definition of who the fuck is in charge but you also know that given the fact that Antifa and BLM are not organizations. They are grassroots and local and they don’t have defined leadership.  

Like come on what the fuck would the fascist BLM regime even look like? “Who’s in charge” “we are” ok but who is the leader “we are” are you actually being serious and why are so many people in relative agreement.

Fascism is right wing. One sentence that we actually agree upon. Then you take a sharp  turn into fucking lala land 
BLM is actually right wing? Hm let’s just think about that for like half a second. Right wing=conservative left wing= Liberal. Is that fair for me to assume? 
Conservative-strong moral based, desire for maintaining and stuff like that we know what they are.
Liberal- progressives. 

By what stretch of reasoning could you use to convince yourself that BLM is conservative and is not liberal?

But let’s play along and say that BLM is right wing and is actually very conservative, well what would be the left wing to that? What would be the liberal alternative that exists currently that is on the left wing? All lives matter? Is that ass backward too? Is all lives matter actually a bunch of liberals? If that’s the case then everyone has an uncle or two who is going to be very fucking confused.  I don’t fucking know man, I’m trying to go along with it but it’s really hard 

Here’s a fucking hint if something is a MOVEMENT it is inherently going to be liberal because there is something about their world they desire to change.

Okay, fascists are right wing and they are conservative by nature as opposed to being liberal. Given this fact, fascism is going to be vehemently opposed to progressive values because they will preserve the things they believe right? Is that fair to say? 
SO HOW CAN EITHER OF THESE THINGS POSSIBLY BE RIGHT WING?!?

Look I wanted to dice up this whole thing, but then but then I realized  I don’t think I can possibly defeat this degree of stupid. I’m just gunna leave it here but if you ask I’ll answer 

*edit* there is no fucking way this post isn’t actually master level alt right bullshit. You fucking got me 😂 I will leave my response up because you earned it. Well done 

.... I need a fucking cigarette
I know it’s not grammatically incorrect to put a space before between the end of a word and the punctuation mark, but it is deeply unsettling.
Reading the first article you linked..

> Joe Biden needs a concrete solution

I read through the section, they barely touched on Joe, except at the end where they suggested if he had a plan he's keeping it to himself.

The dude holds no political office, the fuck do they think he's going to do?
