Title: CMV: Women’s Toplessness Should Be Legal and Not Censored Online 


Post:
To clarify before going any further, I believe it is acceptable for companies and platforms, or even governments, to put restrictions on **public sexual activity** or **sexual activity uploaded online in places meant to be free from it.** To clarify before going any further, I believe it is acceptable for companies and platforms, or even governments, to put restrictions on **public sexual activity** or **sexual activity uploaded online in places meant to be free from it.** So if someone is uploading porn or publically engaging in behavior for sexual gratification, I think that is valid grounds for moderation and regulation.

That being the case, I **reject** the notion that women merely displaying their breasts is some kind of pornographic or sexual activity. I believe the existing censorship of women’s toplessness, whether online or in public, is an outdated and unjust double standard. Laws and policies that require women to keep their breasts or nipples covered, while giving men unlimited freedom to bare their chests is **unjustifiable and nakedly unfair**. And it is especially hypocritical for countries or companies to support these gender-discriminatory practices while at the same time claiming to be in favor of gender equality. This is just a contradictory set of ideas, equally as absurd and irrational as professing to be in favor of equal rights and then saying there are some rights women shouldn’t have.

# Reasoning Behind My View

# 1. Gender Equality and Bodily Autonomy

At its core, allowing men to be topless while policing women to cover up is a direct violation of gender equality. And, **assuming you care about gender equality**, women should have the same rights to bodily autonomy and freedom of expression as men. If a man can walk shirtless on the beach or post a topless photo online without consequence, why should a woman be penalized for doing the same?

This type of control just sends a message that women’s choices are subject to societal approval in a way that men’s are not.

# 2. The Flawed Argument of Sexualization

The most common justification for censoring women’s toplessness is that “men and women are biologically different” and that “women have breasts” and that breasts are “sexual objects” or “secondary sexual characteristics” that require covering. However:

* Breasts are not sex organs. They have a biological function (nursing) unrelated to sexual activity. The sexualization of breasts is a cultural construct, not some biological one. As a cultural construct and imposed-standard of decency, it can obviously be challenged and opposed. It’s not some immutable thing.
* If we apply the “we should cover them up because breasts are secondary sexual characteristics” logic, it falls apart under scrutiny. Men’s beards, broad shoulders, and deep voices are also secondary sexual characteristics influenced by hormones like testosterone. Should we demand that men cover their chests, shave their beards, or avoid speaking in public to avoid *distracting others*? Should women not be allowed to wear tight-fitting clothing because yoga pants or bikinis might show off some body hair or proportionally wider hips (which are also a product of puberty)?

# 3. Slippery Slopes in Policing Self-Expression

Once we accept the premise that certain body parts must be censored for being “too sexual,” where does it stop? Historically, societies have policed everything from skirts to bikinis, from yoga pants to tank tops. In some places, even swimwear was once considered indecent.

Censoring women’s toplessness could lead to further restrictions on clothing that highlights body shapes or other secondary sexual characteristics. For instance:

* Should men’s speedos be banned because they highlight muscle tone or body shape or bulges?
* Should yoga pants or form-fitting dresses be outlawed for women because they emphasize curves?

Why not force everyone to be in a niqab, covered from head to toe so they cannot be sexualized. This way we can maintain a peak level of modesty these policies seem to be begging for.

# 4. Harmful Consequences of Censorship

Censoring women’s toplessness isn’t just unfair; it’s harmful:

* **Reinforces Inequality:** It perpetuates the notion that women’s bodies are inherently inappropriate or shameful.
* **Victim-blames Women:** It shifts the blame for sexualization onto women rather than addressing the attitudes that sexualize them in the first place.
* **Stifles Freedom:** It limits women’s ability to participate equally in public spaces and online platforms, where their content is disproportionately flagged or removed compared to men’s for clothing-related issues. There are way too many AI content moderation bots that will delete posts or blur images just because they feature a hint of a woman’s bust. 

# 5. Social Media and Real-World Double Standards

Platforms like Instagram, or Facebook or TikTok ban images/videos of women’s nipples (in most contexts) but allow shirtless photos of men. This censorship continues to strengthen the idea that women’s bodies are objects to be regulated, while men’s are neutral and acceptable. In an age where social media is the town square, where everyone is using it, such policies only further the status quo and firmly ingrains the idea that women’s bodies should be covered up in peoples’ minds.

# Addressing Counterarguments

1. **“But breasts are inherently sexual.”**Sexualization is learned and culturally specific. In many societies, women’s toplessness is normal and not seen as provocative. Changing societal norms is possible and can start with exposure and removing this predatory censorship scheme.
2. **“This could lead to exploitation.”**Exploitation stems from societal behaviors, not from women’s choices to expose their bodies. Holding individuals accountable for objectification is the solution, not restricting women’s rights. It would be like banning women from going outside because there’s a chance of being murdered. Deal with the murderers. Don’t put a cap on women’s freedom.   
3. **“We need to protect minors.”**Protecting minors means addressing the root causes of over-sexualization and teaching them to view bodies in a healthy, non-sexualized way. If boys can be topless, so can girls. Even if breasts are still sexualized in modern society, girls should be allowed to display them in social contexts where boys can. Bikinis and swimsuits for girls are sexualized by people too. Is it really “protecting minors” to ban all this swimwear? Don’t punish the victims.  
4. **“Social media companies are ultimately profit-seeking companies. They create guidelines based on what their global communities want.”**If global sensitivity standards are the reason why all of these platforms are censoring or shadow-banning women’s bodies, despite the inequality of it all, why stop there? Many of the countries around the world are racist, transphobi, homophobic, ableist and a million other things. Why not make even more discriminatory policies if it can mean appealing better to global communities? I think the reason should be self-explanatory. Even if companies want to cater to bigots, it is unethical for them to. And so they should face legal sanctions for it.

(Dis)Honorary Mentions:

1. **“But I wouldn’t want to see my grandma’s tits!”**Your sensitivities should not come at the expense of her ability to dress like how she wants.  
2. **“No man would be ok with their woman being topless in front of other men.”**Women are individuals before they are partners to their spouses. Men should not be able to take rights away from women, just as how women cannot take them away from men.  
3. **“This is such a first-world problem and there are more important issues to worry about that affect both men and women!”**Multiple issues can be addressed simultaneously. Something like not censoring women’s bodies may actually be one of the more easily achievable ones relative to “ending all domestic violence”. This is really not a valid criticism.

So, censoring women’s toplessness only increases inequality, breeding harmful attitudes. Women should have the same freedoms as men to decide how to present their bodies, both online and in public. By normalizing toplessness, we can challenge repressive norms, reduce hyper-sexualization, and promote egalitarianism.

Change my mind.

Ok, I see two main arguments: (1) breasts are not inherently sexual and (2) gender inequality. Is that about right?

1) Whether or not breasts are "inherently" or "biologically" sexual objects I don't think should matter. Sexuality and inappropriateness is societally defined and agreed upon not something that arrives from "inherent" qualities. 

For instance, imagine someone saying that "words are just vibrations in the air, they're not inherently sexual. Therefore, I should be able to give graphic descriptions of sex on my kids show." Or take a bannana and a mouth, both non-sexual objects. But, used in a particular way, we would consider the use to be obscene and not appropriate for children.

Like it or not, currently women's breasts are seen that way. Maybe you want it changed. Maybe I want it to be ok to deepthroat bananas because that's just how I like to eat them. Both of us need to get enough of society to agree with us on that. We can't just declare that the rest of society is wrong and we are right.

2) Gender inequality in sexual expression is a part of what society agrees on and is not necessarily a huge injustice or even a bad thing. As you said, people have different parts. Women's breasts are generally different than man's.

For a gender difference you might agree with, do you think it's more obscene for a man to war a skin tight outfit with their bulge protruding out compared to a woman in a skin tight outfit with no bulge? I'd say they're two obviously different things and the man is much more obscene there. There's gender inequality, but I don't see that as a problem.
Women's toplessness *is* legal online in the US.  Also, The First Amendment allows social media companies to decide what is and is not allowed (within what is allowed by law) on their online platforms.  Why should the government force social media platforms to allow users to post photos & videos of exposed female breasts on their platforms if it is not the type of content that they want on their platforms? Why should these companies be stripped of their First Amendment right in this regard?

*"The sexualization of breasts is a cultural construct, not some biological one."*

So? That doesn't mean it doesn't exist in the cultures in which it exists.  Many groups online and in real life prefer to avoid even the possibility that someone might suspect there is something sexual going on. Why should they not be allowed to make that decision for themselves? Why should an organization that runs say, a swim program for pubescent teenagers not be allowed to require the girls and women to wear tops to avoid the perception of inappropriateness just because the very real sexualized way in which the boys see their breasts is a social construct? Not every group or person wants to be on the front lines of changing cultural norms, nor should any be forced to do so.
Pt.1 Counter-counter-argument 

Humans are the only animals where breasts grow during sexual maturity—not just when needed for breastfeeding. Human breasts are an evolutionarily developed sexual attraction that precedes and supercedes culture.


[Breast development is a vital part of puberty in the human female. Unlike other mammals, however, human females are the only ones who develop full breasts long before they are needed to nurse their offspring.](https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/normal-breast-development)

…also it’s also *simply just not true* that that sexualization is only learned—***all*** animal species on earth are inherently sexual.
I think what should happen first is the desexualization of women's bodies which would take a long time. 

As a result, I'm genuinely in favor of men having their social media posts flagged for displaying their chest and it should be temporarily illegal for them to be shirtless. I'm actually not joking 

It is a double standard and I think forcing them to follow the same rule might be the only way for them to see how it feels.
In practice, we have an online culture where hardcore porn is all over, including on reddit.  There is nothing stopping any women or men who wish to show anything they want except an NSFW tag.

The reason all this stuff is behind 'NSFW' is in the name - workplaces have had lawsuits from decades of prior practices of sexual harassment.  So it is basically illegal to look at anything NSFW at work if it is possible for IT or your coworkers to see it.  (not illegal but you probably will lose your job)

Naturally the work rules apply, [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hello-human-resources](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hello-human-resources) , if your coworker is attracted to you enough you can probably get caught looking at hardcore porn by him or her and it will go about how you would expect.

Broader society seems to be shifting the same way.  Many from gen Z seem to be just fine with their nudes online, since everyone else from their generation seems to have them posted as well.  (not *everyone* but a lot)
I think your reasoning is mostly correct but it is still putting the cart before the horse. Without any prior cultural evolution, permitting topless women without any context on most platforms would on net, increase repressive norms, increase hyper-sexualization and depress egalitarianism.

There was a UK tabloid that was notorious for putting topless women on page 3 or page 6. It did nothing really to reduce inequality despite their protests to the contrary. I believe any normalizing content would be heavily outweighed by this kind of centerfold-esque stuff. 

It makes more sense to transition culture by allowing certain forms of topless content first, such as medical or clinical content. Leave prurient content last, for when people's attitudes have evolved.
FYI, in Ontario, Canada it is legal for women to go topless and has been for 31 years now. Not once have I ever seen a woman topless in public.
You don't say where you're from, but my state only outlaws intentional **genital** exposure of a sexual nature that is visible in a public place.

That not to say that society doesn't impose its own restrictions on women's bodies that are different to men's bodies, but these differences are not codified in law where I live.

Other institutions and businesses are free to create their own rules, and if these rules violate any anti-discrimination laws then they can be challenged in court.
