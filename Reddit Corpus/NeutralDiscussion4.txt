Title: How Much of America’s Polarization Is Engineered by Foreign Influence?

Post:
In today’s political landscape, it feels like polarization and mistrust are at an all-time high. But what if this isn’t just the natural evolution of political discourse? What if much of it has been engineered—deliberately stoked by adversaries exploiting our divisions?

This is the premise of a journal I’ve been working on, titled *“The Silent War - Weaponizing Division.”* I'm exploring how foreign adversaries like Russia, China, and Iran have turned social media into a weapon, targeting the heart of American democracy (and democracies in general) by amplifying existing divisions and eroding trust in institutions.

**How It’s Done:**

	1.	**Disinformation Campaigns:**

   * Troll farms and bots flood platforms with divisive content tailored to inflame issues like race, religion, and political ideology.
   * Viral posts, often created by adversaries, pit citizens against each other, making compromise and unity seem impossible.

	2.	**Algorithmic Polarization:**

   * Social media algorithms prioritize content that provokes strong emotional reactions—anger, fear, or outrage.
   * Moderates are drowned out, while extremes are amplified, creating echo chambers that distort reality.

	3.	**Trust Erosion:**

   * Disinformation doesn’t just lie; it makes people doubt everything. Elections, media, even neighbors become suspect.
   * Surveys show trust in institutions is at historic lows, leaving a population more vulnerable to authoritarian influence.

**The Impact:**

* **Deepening Divides:** Conversations across political lines are increasingly rare, replaced by suspicion and hostility.
* **Erosion of Democracy:** A disengaged, disillusioned electorate is less likely to participate, weakening democratic processes.
* **Foreign Influence:** Adversaries gain strategic advantages as a fractured America struggles to function cohesively.

Here’s an excerpt from my journal

*“The foundation of any democracy is trust—trust in leaders, institutions, and each other. But adversaries didn’t need to destroy that trust directly. They only had to point out the cracks and let the system crumble from within. With every scandal, every conflict, the fractures deepened.”*

**Questions for Discussion:**

* To what extent do you think foreign influence is responsible for the current state of polarization in the U.S.?
* Should social media platforms bear responsibility for the way their algorithms amplify division?
* What measures can we take to rebuild trust in institutions and one another in this deeply fractured environment?

This is a conversation we all need to have. The silent war is real, and its consequences affect everyone and everyone to come.

Idk, I understand the skepticism of the other comments but I remember roughly 20 years ago back when I was a conservative evangelical fundie in my teens being taken aback when someone made a comment about how Putin was a strong leader. Now look where we are.
It’s clear the Cold War never ended, Russia just transitioned from USSR1 to USSR2:

And they are beating us at our own table. But they didn’t make the table or even the rules of the game. Because when the Cold War ended, we replaced the capitalism vs communism dynamic with a capitalism vs government (our own) dynamic. 

And now that corporations are the size of small governments and individuals have the wealth of formerly large corporations, our social structures are so weakened that Russia need only insert itself into the gaps we made in our own society.

So they are hastening our decline but only because we made our country unsustainable.
It's pretty much homegrown.  The Russians et. al. are really riffing off of stuff that Americans are already doing.

This is a byproduct of post-JFK politics as the WASP segregationists migrated from the Dems to the GOP, where there were already Bircher conspiracy theorists with whom they could unite.

Goldwater began the process of cultivating a GOP populist base that opposed civil rights, contrary to the northeastern GOP establishment at the time.  Strom Thurmond, who had run as a segregationist Dixiecrat, defected to the Republicans, thus paving the way for the realignment.

Reagan was an establishment dealmaker behind the scenes, but played the angry populist in the vein of Goldwater.  Newt Gingrich punted the dealmaking and turned up the anger, which has killed bipartisanship ever since.

The counterintuitive answer is that the country was better off when the Southern segregationists were not in the same party as the conspiracy theorists.  Those two blocs are stronger together than they were when they were apart.

LBJ should have remembered the adage of keeping your friends close and your enemies closer.  If the conservative WASPs could share a party with the northeastern Catholics who they despised, then they could have found a way to broker an uncomfortable coalition that also included black voters.
I studied this question in college in the late 2010s for a Poli-Sci undergrad paper. My impression then was not much, I think post Covid that may have changed especially post Russo-Ukraine War outbreak where Russia really began investing in expanding the disinformation infrastructure but in \~2017-2018 it was definitely a somewhat minor effect.

Low-investment Bots, Trolls, and Shill accounts had very marginal influence on peoples views. Posting a 2 sentence comment doesn't really matter or work at influencing people, the vast majority of bots were failures. The more effective strategies were to boost organic narratives via fake engagement in the hopes it would be more widely seen or try to use more high-investment spokespeople e.g (RT, Jackson Hinkle, Max Blumenthal) to seed/boost narratives in alternative media again with bots/shills used to boost fake engagement rates to make them appear more algorithmically.  Both of these were modestly effective particularly in conspiratorial communities and less-educated left-wing communities but not very.

I would attribute polarization more to the breakdown of a top-down media ecosystem due to the rise of the internet. Professional commentators tend to be more moderate and take their cues from institutions (for better or worse but probably better given the alternative). Internet commentators had always been more partisan and less informed. This was particularly true on the rabid right-wing internet ecosystem that existed well into the 1990s but really got going \~late 2000s/early 2010s. This ecosystem was already radical and somewhat conspiratorial and when the right moved from email-chains to social media networks it became much more effective. Influence operations might have given it a small boost but the reality was it didn't need it.

The Republican Party was sort of able to select via Fox News and messaging how much they wanted to rile up their base but they lost control with the internet and they can no longer as effectively shape discontent to politically "productive" use and instead it began to spiral into increasingly conspiratorial anti-system thinking that often was at odds with what the party wanted to do. The same can kind of be said about the rise of the left but this has been much less effective for now.
The ultra wealthy who live right here in the United States and the enormous influence they hold over the media landscape today play a far greater role in driving the division/polarization we see today than any foreign influence campaign. 


This is not really anything new (ex. yellow journalism/muckrakers and bigtime newspaper magnates like Hearst who were buddies with key industrial titans controlling the messaging during the guilded age) but it has gotten a lot worse lately. We enjoyed a long period of relative independence and objectively in the news media starting around the Great Depression. However, this began to wane by around 2000 thanks to influences such as Murdoch/ Fox News,  the end to limitations on owning multiple media outlets in a single market or too many altogether and restrictions being lifted that required equal air time for different points of view. 


These days, we now have to deal with increasingly consolidated media interests either driving division for the ratings/profit or advancing a partisan agenda that benefits their bottom line and/or the long term interests of their owners. I'm sure that foreign interests help drive dissent and misinformation, but I think their influence tends to be significantly overstated. It probably shouldn't come as a huge shocker that the media establishment seems to often bring up that foreign meddling narrative but practically NEVER discusses the influence of the ultra wealthy in driving the same kind of misinformation and division for their own personal gain. It just seems there's too much of likelihood that they do that in part at least to distract attention away from other potential causes and to also bring in more ad revenue/clicks like always since it's a story that would grab people's attention.
Here’s another question: knowing that foreign entities have used “trolls” (people basically roleplaying and stirring the pots in political discussions online,) why is it not considered more often that our domestic political parties and campaigns might be doing the same thing?
In addition to the vectors you've stated, you should look at outright bribes from foreign actors to legislators and the media.  Several Representatives were thought to have been on Russia's payroll back in 2016.  Two Russian agents were indicted earlier this year for funneling money to a right-wing media company named Tenet Media.  Putin is outright buying good press and favorable legislation in America to the extent that he can get it.  To a smaller extent the same is probably happening with China and Iran, as well as with a few allied nations such as Israel.
Recently, not that much. Americans are perfectly capable of dividing themselves. Foreign powers (esp Russia, but also China/Israel and to a more limited extent Iran) are widening the cracks, but they're mostly pre-existing cracks being chipped at.

But in the grand scheme of modern history, US political polarisation has been driven by one force more than any other: Fox News. Fox News was created by Rupert Murdoch in 1996, 11 years after he became an American citizen. So it depends a lot on whether you consider an Australian-born man trying to turn the US into a terrifying hellscape as foreign influence or not (similarly, Elon Musk, a white South African-born man seems to be trying to convert the US to apartheid).
