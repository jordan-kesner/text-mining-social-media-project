Grind/hustle culture - Needing to constantly post/create content in order to stay relevant.

Monetization of hobbies - Offshoot of hustle culture, but pressure to turn your pastimes/hobbies into a money making scheme/work.

Failure to protect minors/respect consent - I'm all for adults expressing themselves as adults, but not everyone consents to seeing sexual/graphic content. Not enough people use NSFW warnings.

Glorifying sex - Along the same lines, talent, skills, and interesting content isn't usually pushed as much as sexual content. Sends the message (both to creators and minors) that in order to be successful you need to be "sexy".

Niche Communities being commodified - The invasion of people who aren't interested in a hobby/topic swooping in to try to make money or sell you something.

These are just the first few that come to mind. It's really sad to see so many communities go from a bunch of people being excited about the things they love/artists creating out of passion, to this soulless, corporate atmosphere that feels incredibly fake and inauthentic. 

I miss that "Old YouTube" feel, where creators put out raw, unpolished work that was only shared because they wanted to show off what they love. The over processing/insane amount of time and money spent on production leads to gatekeeping and devaluing of honest people who don't have the same resources/are making do with what they have.
The constant selling posts annoy me to no end, I simply mute and/or unfollow people, it’s called SOCIAL media not selling media

Societal problem I’d say is painting an unrealistic depiction of their lives.  There’s no real checks and balances, so people can pretend to have this glamorous life (when they don’t) and it makes other people feel like they need to compare themselves or feel guilty because they can’t live up to these fake standards
2 main issues with social media: 

1. Reality is distorted on current social media. With just a few clicks you can remove objects from any picture, make your skin smoother, and your waist smaller. AR Filters and Factune create unrealistic beauty standards that are unattainable without photoshop. How many more times are we going to see a photoshop fail because people are just trying to keep up with the standards society is setting on social media? In my eyes, there's no wonder why teens have such low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and other mental health issues. They spend all day on social media watching a fake reality, then feel bad when they look in the mirror. 
2. Social media is becoming less social. TikTok is not social media its entertainment. Instagram used to be social (you'd actually see your friend's post), but it's becoming more like TikTok every day. It's all about doom scrolling and how long you can be sucked into their app. 

What is more authentic than the daily lives of people? There is no better way than this to  
learn about the different cultures around the world and how people live there.f people from around the world and different cultures via the things they post on social media.

REALITY IS BEAUTIFUL!  #daylyy
A slew of attention-seeking girls with many issues and generous genetics trying to fill the gap of attention from their surroundings with the attention from the internet by posting tits or ass content every day all day.  


Other types of bros and hoes faking everything they can just to get those VYUS.   


Dumpster acting pranks and other types of $hit content makers-beggars just again trying to get those numbers up - followers/views/shares, give me anything bro.   


Anime-inspired "gamers" jumping on every dumb trend which rises to the top.  


I'll stop here but if I got more I'll come back.
My biggest social media problem is algorithms not showing my work to people

Far & away the most painful issue for me
So narcissism is kind of a big one for me and why I left social media for the most part (still have them but don't post other than nature pics). Like everyone is posting the same shit like they are special (including me) and I was like what a waste of time/not really healthy. 

Facebook and Twitter are being overrun by misinformation and really crazy people. I know Facebook wanted engagement so they show you an ad that will makes you mad and maybe engage with crazy people...which I did the last login lol. Honestly both are just so cancerous now. Like under a Facebook post about 'girl power' for my local weather station there are a bunch of anti-maskers and covid deniers upset about them wearing masks. These people are upset while our hospitals are getting wrecked right now in our county. 

So yea censorship is an extremely hard one. I get that banning people with different "opinions" could be problematic but at the same time is it really good for society to let anti-science nuts spewing misinformation everywhere without consequences? Donno. After typing this out though going to delete my Facebook and Instagram. Had them just for marketplace but kinda tired.
Thinking the spread of misinformation and how it erodes democracy should be near the top of everyone’s list, as should be the lack of regulation that contributes to centralized control and the spread of misinformation, as well as how that misinformation can lead to real-world violence.
