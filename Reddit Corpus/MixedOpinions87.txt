Title: CMV: Men and women who make false rape claims should be forced to register as sex offenders.

Post:
Before I begin my argument I'd like to establish this first. When I say false rape claims I do not mean cases like [Rapist Brock Turner's Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_v._Turner) where it's a safe assumption based on the evidence that they committed the crime yet somehow get away with it. I am not trying to dissuade actual victims. If you are a victim seek legal action if you haven't already.

I mean cases where evidence of the claim is either completely unfounded and/or falsified or it is later found out that the claims made against the accused where false. Cases such as:


[Jemma Belle](http://www.thejournal.ie/woman-makes-false-rape-sexual-assault-claims-innocent-men-3482764-Jul2017/) who...

> Within the space of four years, Beale claimed she had been seriously sexually assaulted by six men and raped by nine, all strangers, in four different attacks.

[Response from one of the men she accused](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-surrey-11676804)

[Karen Farmer](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-33391739)

[The *A Rape on Campus* Rolling Stone article by Sabrina Erdely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rape_on_Campus) where a gang rape claim against the local chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. (I'm a member at another chapter so I personal stake with this one)

[The claim against Aziz Ansari](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/01/the-humiliation-of-aziz-ansari/550541/) (No presses charged but you can see the effect it had on his life)


I could go on but I'll stop there. In most of these cases the false accuser was punished to some capacity, however it's not enough. Making false claims of rape is just as destructive as committing the act. Where a victim of actual sexual violence might experience both physical and psychological trauma that effects their daily life and/or may face backlash in their socialite in one way or another; the victim of a false accusation faces something similar nature. They are blackballed from society and socially ostracized for actions they did not commit. Even if justice comes their way the damage is already done and you can never truly get rid of that brand. It also makes finding justice for actual victims much harder. Much like how the abuse of a medicine (like Adderall, opioids, etc.) makes it harder by placing more scrutiny on people that would actually benefit from it; the same can be said about false rape claims.

Now, why make them register as sex offenders? Well thats fairly simple; if an individual is willing enough to construct a falsified claim as a way to deface and/or imprison an innocent man or woman' then they clearly not meant to be trusted by society, their workplace (current or future), and anywhere else they could easily inflict damage on more innocent people.

So what do you think? Do you disagree? Am I being too harsh or not harsh enough? I'm interested in hearing what you have to say.

Change my mind. (As they say)


Edit: Formatting

Edit: I'll get to as many of your responses as possible. Fact checking the counter arguments (both yours and mine)

**Important Edit:** A lot of you are asking how would you go about finding if the claim was false. I did some digging and here is a Journal of psychology that proposes a way to discern fact from truth. They state: "We propose a new theory based on the literature, the theory of fabricated rape. The theory of fabricated rape predicts that differences between the story of a false complainant and a true victim will arise because a false complainant has to fabricate an event that was not experienced and a true victim can rely on recollections of the event. On the one hand, the false complainant is lying and will behave as liars do. On the other hand, she is constructing a story based on her own experiences and her beliefs concerning rape. If the experiences do not resemble rape and the beliefs concerning rape are not valid, detectable differences between a true story of rape and a false story of rape, a fabricated rape, will arise. The current study will test the validity of a list of differing characteristics between false and true allegations constructed based on the suggested theory of fabricated rape"

Edit: Found a way to deal with it on a case by case basis [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/87ncab/cmv_men_and_women_who_make_false_rape_claims/dwe7ly8/) however I think we could still talk long term punishment

The problem here is that you would need two separate legal procedures: one to determine that the rapist is innocent, another to determine that the purported victim is in fact falsifying their claims.  The latter does not necessarily follow from the former, and if you are going to impose legal consequences you need to establish those facts in court.  Just as it is incumbent upon rape victims to speak up and bring their assailants to court, it should be incumbent upon the victim of a falsified claim to sue and make that person accountable.  I haven't researched this, but I am willing to bet this is already possible under the law.  
The sexual offenders list is ridiculous on the face of it, since the people interested in false accusers, and the response needed is *entirely* different from those interested in, and the response to, sexual offenders. 

It's really really a bad idea to make those the same list. But let's imagine that we create a *new* list that lists false accusers. Should it only be for this crime? Or all crimes? The latter makes a lot more sense, as the sexual offenders list similarly covers a wide range of only vaguely related offenses.

So... How does someone get on this list. To be proportionate, it should be similar to how you get on the sexual offenders list. AKA, *being convicted of perjury beyond a reasonable doubt*. 

If all you're saying that the list of people convicted of perjury should be public... well... actually... it already is. So I suppose you mean that it should be *publicized* more. 

Is that a fair assessment of a reasonable approach to your view?
Why the hell should perjurers be prevented from living near elementary schools or required to attend sex offender group and individual therapy?
I understand your frustration in this matter, but I think it is misplaced. To begin, I think that we already have extremely effective systems for both avoiding false accusations rising to the point of criminal liability for the accused, and mechanisms for punishing accusers who intentionally falsely accuse. I would point out, for instance, that according to this [Home Office study](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100408125722/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf) the rate at which false accusations reach criminal liability is probably extremely low. For instance, of the 216 complaints that were classified as false, only 126 had even gotten to the stage where the accuser lodged a formal complaint. Of those, only 39 complainants named a suspect. Of those, only six actually led to an arrest, and only two led to charges being brought. So, if we assume that ~4% of accusations are false (which is the typical percentage given by criminologists), only 1% of those 4% can be expected to result in charges being brought. That's four false arrests for every 10,000 accusations. We can also assume that only a small minority of people are serving time in prison due to a false accusation. If you search the [National Exoneration Database](http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/browse.aspx) you find that since 1989 there have only been 52 cases where men have been exonerated for being falsely accused of sexual assault. Meanwhile, there were 790 cases of people being exonerated for murder. Given how much more common sexual assault accusations are than murder accusations, it makes the low numbers of sexual assault exonerations more astounding. 

My point being that we can't just require that false accusations result in a sex offender registration because it would catch way way too many people who have not even caused any harm. The majority of false accusations, as I pointed out, don't even name the accused. So, what harm have they caused? Even when the accused is named, the most likely outcome is that the accusation is withdrawn and the police move on. The person being accused never even knows they have been accused in the majority of cases.

It gets even more complicated when we did deeper. According to this [study](http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/3925/4925HomeComputer/Rape%20myths/Police.pdf), and this [study](https://icdv.idaho.gov/conference/handouts/False-Allegations.pdf), around half of false rape accusations are made by someone other than the claimed victim. This can include friends, roommates, and most often parents. Their claim may have no substance to it but they don't know that. In most cases, they are worried about the 'victim' and don't know how to help them. Should they really be punished for that? This interesting [study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/237582.pdf) found that in the jurisdiction they reviewed, of the 55 people who filed false rape accusations, 18 involved persons with mental illnesses. Another 6 accusations involved persons who required medical attention that they could not afford. For instance, one individual admitted that they pretended they had been sexually assaulted because they knew it would mean that they could then get a pregnancy and STD test done for free (see page 67). Obviously, this is selfish behaviour, but I don't think it rises to the level of deserving to be on the sex offender registry because she only wanted the medical attention. She never gave the police enough information to actually bring a case forward. I certainly don't think the mentally ill people should be on the registry. That's just a way to stigmatize an already discriminated against minority even more, thereby making it much harder to treat and accommodate them.

There's a final important point I'd like to make. Specifically, predators actually typically target the very demographics that are most likely to make false accusations. This includes teenagers, people with severe mental illness, people with criminal records, people with drug habits, etc. These people are vulnerable to rapists, who often are aware of which victims are most likely to be mistrusted by authorities. Adding a further barrier to these people coming forward with their accusations (which I hope I've shown are often not intentionally false, or false in a manner that we ought to impose a liability on them) increases their vulnerability. Imagine the kind of power this gives a potential rapist. You've probably heard stories about rapists telling their victims, "if you say anything to anyone I'll come back and kill/hurt you." Now consider the possibility that they could now say, "if you say anything to anyone they might not believe you and YOU will end up on the sex offender registry." Even worse is the case of a rapist who could now specifically target people who are on the registry because of a false accusation. What chance does that person now have of making their legitimate Although the accounts of these complainants need careful scrutiny, police should take them more seriously, not less seriously, and victims should be more confident that they can come forward without serious repercussions (except, of course, in the most dramatic of scenarios). 

Fyi, you spelled Jemma Baele incorrectly. Also, she got 10 years in prison for her false accusations. In Canada, the ***maximum*** sentence for sexual assault is 10 or 14 years (depending on the victim's age). Even some extremely serious cases don't come close to the maximum sentence. For instance, in *[R v FHL, 2018 ONCA 83](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2018/2018onca83/2018onca83.html?resultIndex=1)* (caution, this is your trigger warning for sexual assault if you choose to click on that link) the accused sexually assaulted his girlfriend's 12 year old daughter, who then gave birth to a child. He got 8 years. In New York State, a majority of sexual assaults are Class E or D felonies. These carry maximum sentences of 4 or 7 years, respectively. Class C and B felonies carry maximums of 14 and 25 years, but these are rarer than the aforementioned felonies. Notably, perjury in the first degree is a Class D felony, so it carries the same maximum sentence as many sexual assaults. In Canada, perjury carries a maximum sentence of 14 years, so it's even higher than a majority of sexual assaults. My point being, perjury is an extremely serious offense than can result in extremely serious penalties if proven. In many jurisdictions, the penalties for perjury often exceed those for sexual assault. I do not see the need to increase those penalties even further by adding sex offender registration.
[False reporting](https://thelawdictionary.org/article/what-happens-when-you-file-a-false-police-report/) is already a crime and people get [charged with](http://www.amestrib.com/news/20180313/two-charged-with-filing-false-drive-by-shooting-report) it. Why should rape get a worse punishment than false reporting other crimes like child abuse, murder, physical assault, stalking, etc.? I imagine being falsely accused of being a murderer could do damage to a person's reputation. 

What about something like [mistaken identity](http://kuow.org/post/why-police-lineups-often-fail)? Unless you know the rapist, which of course is true in most cases but not all, it's pretty easy to misidentify someone. Eye witness testimony is very unreliable. How does that get remedied in this situation?

The one thing I don't see mentioned is that in a lot of "false accusation" statistics, they include actual rapes where the victim recants or drops charges. Unless police feel the need to go for false charges, most cases get dropped and no one tries to investigate whether it's because it's provably false or the victim dropped charges for some reason or another. The reason a victim may do this is because of the [trauma of reporting](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/apr/13/rape-sexual-assault-frances-andrade-court) and going through prosecuting someone, [police not believing them](http://www.newsweek.com/police-slut-shame-rape-sex-assault-nypd-district-attorney-investigation-688796), [social treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1705531/) for coming out as a rape victim, lack of evidence, harassment, [being pressured into dropping charges](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2014/sep/01/raped-pressured-dropping-charges-police-university-oxford), being bullied, or they just want to get out of the system and get back to their life as these things can sometimes take years. None of this is an admission of lying, and in most cases, police aren't going to look into any of this to figure out if it's provably false or not.

[Here's an article](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/for_some_victims_reporting_a_rape_can_bring_doubt_abuse_and_even_prosecutio/) that includes three instances where women were charged and convicted for false reporting when they were actually telling the truth. What recourse should they get? Should the police go on the sex offender list for lying about people who have really been raped?

So many victims are accused of lying when they are not that knowing they are likely to be aggressively prosecuted to the point of being put on the sex offender list *will* discourage more victims from coming forward with reports. 

Edit: Also on your other points, plenty of men are accused of rape and go on to be successful. [R Kelly](https://pitchfork.com/news/r-kelly-accused-of-grooming-minor-as-his-sex-pet/) is facing new accusations and he has been very credibly accused in the past, yet he somehow has never faced social, financial, or occupational repercussions for it. Donald Trump has faced many credible accusations and has publicly said he grabs women by the pussy without consent and he was elected president. Bill Clinton's issues beyond the accused rape would include the power the president of the United States would inherently have over an intern and the reason that makes it difficult for an intern to actually consent, yet that isn't really spoken about and Monica got more vitriol than he ever did. Dr. Luke was allowed to keep his power over Kesha. Kobe Bryant, Shaun White, Terry Richardson (photographer), Woody Allen, Charlie Sheen, and Rob Lowe all faced accusations and sometimes arrests or civil cases for various charges of sexual assault, harassment, abuse, etc and their careers don't seem to have faced negative impact. 

Rape victims also face [financial loss](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/04/03/sexual-assault-awareness-month/99834118/), which is something that is not commonly spoken about.
>The estimated lifetime cost of rape was $122,461 per victim, or a population economic burden of nearly $3.1 trillion (2014 U.S. dollars) over victims’ lifetimes, based on data indicating >25 million U.S. adults have been raped. This estimate included $1.2 trillion (39% of total) in medical costs; $1.6 trillion (52%) in lost work productivity among victims and perpetrators; $234 billion (8%) in criminal justice activities; and $36 billion (1%) in other costs, including victim property loss or damage. Government sources pay an estimated $1 trillion (32%) of the lifetime economic burden.
You are in effect suggesting the legal system up the penalty for what is essentially perjury specifically in circumstances involving a specific subset of crimes, and a subset that is already underreported as is. The chilling effect would be astounding.
Regarding the Aziz Ansari thing, what you're suggesting is to make talking about your feelings publicly after a bad date illegal. The events that woman describes DID happen. Aziz did not deny them. The controversy is about whether or not those events were sexual assault. Why on earth should that woman have to be a registered sex offender or face any legal consequences to publicly talking about things that DID happen to her while still not accusing anyone of doing anything illegal? 
>Now, why make them register as sex offenders? Well thats fairly simple; if an individual is willing enough to construct a falsified claim as a way to deface and/or imprison an innocent man or woman' then they clearly not meant to be trusted by society, their workplace (current or future), and anywhere else they could easily inflict damage on more innocent people.

You can use that logic to claim that EVERY false crime claim should be forced to register on the sex offenders list. 

This would also make the sex offender registry less useful; either it'd punish people who make false claims way more than it should by forcing them away from areas involving children, which can make it difficult to find a place to live, or it'd give actual sex offenders a reasonable explanation: They could just say "Hi, I'm on the sex offender list, but I just made a claim that the courts wrongly decided was 'false', so I'm fine."
A sex offender registry is intended to make it easier to identify someone who has been found guilty of committing a sexual crime. Sexual crimes are unique in that the victim experiences a level of trauma, humiliation, and violation that’s very different from being the victim of another crime (i.e. a theft). 

The act of making a false accusation in itself isn’t inherently sexual in nature. Its certainly dishonest, it does have the potential to ruin someone else’s life and it should absolutely be a punishable offence, but falsely accusing someone of rape falls more in line with defamation and perjury than it does a sex crime. 

Also keep in mind that someone is on a sex offender registry it’s safe to assume that the person is a rapist or molester of some sort. If a false accuser is put on the registered its more than likely they’ll be assumed to be a rapist or molester, thereby creating false accusations for a crime they didn’t commit. Yes it would be an ironic sort of karma, but it wouldn’t be fair justice and it would ultimately trivialize the original purpose of a sex offender registry. Would it be fair justice to put someone guilty of stealing a TV on the sex offender registry?
