I  mean, yeah, I think Reddit has made it abundantly clear already that they don't give a shit what we think or want.
Reddit is exploiting people. Honestly, at this point, if anyone is dumb enough to work for a multimillion-dollar company for free - well, that's on them.
If a Reddit share holder wants voting rights, they need to hold Reddit shares with the company’s transfer agent with a pure book account. Holding shares in a broker (street name shares) does not necessarily mean your vote will count because the broker can toss them out. This is true for all stocks- SEC put out a bulletin describing how true stock ownership is directly registered pure book shares with a transfer agent. I’ll link the website below.

But it should not surprise us that Wall Street would pull a fast one and not actually give us true ownership of shares we buy. Those scumbags
