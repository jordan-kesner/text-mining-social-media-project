The ads on scrolling my own feed on facebook already turned me off the app, haven't used it in days anytime I do > I close the app down on the first countdown to an ad. Especially if it comes like an "ad break" while literally watching an ad video....... so stupid. 

Same with instagram... it paused for an ad-break while watching an AD for a book... like... 

Making ads have ad-breaks is just a dumbass stupid Way to kill your own platforms... and then thry have the NERVE to ask us to pay for it to be removed so we can watch the same amount of spamlevel usual ads like before...... 

👌🙄🙄 Hard pass on Anything Meta And X  right now.... 

Reddit for conversations, tiktok for doomscrolling without paying much attention, and Bluesky for my friends. 


Facebook just sewicided with the new ad-arrangement. And X can burn..
