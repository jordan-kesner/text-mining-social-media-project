Title: Social media for artists / illustrators? 

Post:
Although it’s not yet my day job, I am a published author/illustrator. I kept up with all the social media trends for about 6 years with very little reward. When engagement began to only follow short form videos, I slowed down and lost motivation. My instagram app repeatedly stops working making it nearly impossible to engage with the platform or post, so I’ve all but stopped using it. 

I honestly hate filming videos of myself doing art. It takes away from the process, and I have trouble making the process accessible to me disability wise while also making it aesthetic for the camera.

I want to continue building my art career but don’t want to create video content. Is there any photo-centric social media site where posting artwork would work? I have a digital portfolio already and am aware of communities for artists. I’m looking for places I could find exposure to an audience rather than a peer group. Audience tends to include women 25-60 with kids or grandkids, teachers, disabled people or parents of disabled people, and lgbt adolescents and parents. The best platform I see is TikTok, but I don’t wanna make videos… 

Open to hearing about new, small sites as well as long as they are trending upward in popularity. Or if there’s a well established site that just needs to be approached differently as an illustrator? 

Thank you!

I think Deviant Art is going to be a good platform to make use of for arts promotion. I've seen so many of such on the site. 
I appreciate the advice! I should have specified, I’m an illustrator. So my audience is more parents, teachers, and children. Collectors and curators don’t take much notice. I do enjoy group gallery shows locally though! It’s been a while since I’ve entered one. Maybe I’ll dip my toes in that area again to see what happens
