It sounds like a survey I saw posted here on Reddit a couple of weeks ago regarding DACA recipients. [Here's the methodology of the survey from then](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2017/08/27164928/Wong-Et-Al-New-DACA-Survey-2017-Codebook.pdf#page=2). It's very similar to what's described in the article. Opt-in online and very few controls. It's just a shame [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/apr/05/dreamers-need-not-apply-citys-teacher-shortage-overlooks-the-undocumented) didn't call out the survey for being equally junk but instead cited it.  

Nonetheless, assuming accuracy, I agree with the article. The study is junk and shouldn't be taken seriously.
Why is everyone in this thread saying its so unlikely the results are true? The guy who punched Richard Spencer was highly lauded on the internet, especially reddit. Many people think that Nazis (with a varying meaning on what that is exactly) deserve to be punched. And these are peaceful Nazis who are just espousing views, so literally what the title suggests.
The fact that a non-0% of US college students believe that violence is an appropriate response to offensive speech is a problem.
Isn't this opt-in style the same used to reach that 1 and 4 college girls will be sexually assaulted? I think it was if I'm remembering correctly.
I'd say it's higher then that. A number of people will say that they support free speech,    until you bring up someone they don't like. People that actually support free speech are a dieing breed.
Every student gets what makes a democracy from first year government classes. By second year, they have a semi-professional grasp of critical thinking and objective review, with an ear toward the tells of propaganda and emotional manipulation. Friends of America do not attack our institutions through manipulation and misinformation. They honor them.
