Top Comments:
The fact that this guy has chosen not to kill himself and told the police himself that his home is booby-trapped makes you think he has some sort of agenda more so than some psychotic, spontaneous attack.
Additional comments including details of event from brother of victim Jessica Ghawi: http://www.jordanghawi.com/blog/:

"1015 (local): This is what I have been told by Brent, who was with my sister at the time of the shooting. This will be the only statement that I will make on the events surrounding what appears to be her death. 

Jessica and Brent were seated in the middle portion of the theatre when a device was thrown into the theatre that produced a “hissing” sound. The theatre than began to fill with smoke which is when patrons began to move from their seats. At that time, shots were fired. Brent and Jessica immediately dropped to a prone position for cover. Jessica advised multiple times for someone to call 911, which Brent immediately attempted to do. Brent then heard Jessica scream and noticed that she was struck by a round in the leg. Brent, began holding pressure on the wound and attempted to calm Jessica. It was at this time that Brent took a round to his lower extremities. While still administering first aid, Brent noticed that Jessica was no longer screaming. He advised that he looked over to Jessica and saw what appeared to be an entry wound to her head. He further stated that Jessica presented with agonal respirations. Brent then took what may have been his only chance to escape the line of fire and exited the structure where he then contacted my mother. The veracity of any other statements not issued by myself or Peter Burns should be questioned."
[Here's a BuzzFeed interview with OP on his excellent work here on Reddit, keeping everyone informed on the shooting.](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/how-18-year-old-morgan-jones-told-the-world-about)

Edit: I forgot to add a thank-you to OP for his amazing work. Morgan, if you're reading this, please get some rest soon. :) If you really can't sleep, keep your energy levels up with tea and something comforting to eat.
I signed up for a reddit account today to tell you thank you.  

I am a 31-year-old professional on the east coast with a background in journalism.  I have a great deal of love and faith for "traditional" media, and I understand why they are sometimes harder to follow and slower to update.  They have far more liability issues than "crowdsourced" reporting, and far more many bosses to report to.  Usually, when things like this happen, I stick to CNN or another similar news site. 

But today, I came across this, and the heart, organization and intent behind it have made me stay, refreshing periodically and trying to make thoughts out of the hurt in my heart.  

Thank you.
