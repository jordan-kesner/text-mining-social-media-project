Title: Glenn Greenwald: "A main function of corporate media is to attack and demean any social media platform or executive who refuses to take censorship orders and allows free speech on the platform. The goal is to drive away corporate advertisers so no platform with reach can air dissent."

news media having lost its actual journalism function

perhaps needs a Trust Busting to break them up so that they are far harder to control by just a few people
Corporations avoid any sense of conflict as it is never good for business.    Their free speech is where they spend those ad dollars.  Nothing more than that.
Not a very convincing article as it reads no better than a conspiracy theory.   No evidence, no insider quotes even.   Business don't advertise on platforms that push controversial theories....like school shooting being red flag events, or 9/11 being an inside job.   Only companies like mypillow where the owner openly pushes conspiracy theories will advertise on those types of programs.   

This isn't censorship.  This is capitalism.
Why does he describe their speech in terms of violence? He doesn't seem to appreciate corporate media saying what they like.
You must be a very special kind of person if think Glenn Greenwald has any principles as opposed to him figuring out early on that right wing grift pays.
It's more than that, though. Years ago journalism schools switched from teaching journalists to be fair and objective to teaching them to be leftist political activists.
