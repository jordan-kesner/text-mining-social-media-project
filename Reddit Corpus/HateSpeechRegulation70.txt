Thank you for this ''last week on social media''. I hope you keep them coming.  
edit: Damn I just read the last part of the post :S
An extremely interesting update of the Discord, I think it will certainly attract new creators to the platform. 

In general, I think that the future belongs to live content and the integration of users into small thematic communities. I remember watching the development of Twitch a few years ago, when it was bought out by Amazon and what changes have taken place during this time: how much has streaming influenced the development of marketing, the influx of advertisers and the creation of content strategies.
I will recontinue them from January or may be post one last time this year if I got time. Due to holidays, most reddit communities are slowly gone inactive too. 

But in case, you want to receive them. My newsletter link is in bio where I will send next two weeks updates. 

Even though it’s holiday season, it’s Wednesday and 5-6 new updates are already announced ny IG, LinkedIn and others. Another hectic week for marketers.
I believe the same, the human connection in Marketing is increasing as one of the main trends I predict next year to happen is involvement of E-commerce + community. I think Shopify will be doing something like that integrating communities and focusing on keeping Shopify with Tiktok Live Shopping.
