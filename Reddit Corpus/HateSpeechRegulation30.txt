Title: What platform is a better choice for traffic?

Post:
We are planning to start using Youtube or Tiktok to bring more qualified traffic to our online text to speech platform. Which of the two channels would you recommend? Or are there better ways?

the public in both platforms is very different, So i think it depends on which one you want to focus your content to ..
To generate traffic for your text to speech platform my recommendation would be to identify your target audience first and approach them where they are more active.  
  
\> Youtube and Tik Tok both offer easy to consume content so if your target market is based on personal needs, then you can target those who have trouble reading.   
  
\> You can also select other audiences who require your services or further segment your target market based on their locations so check the active number of users of the chosen platforms at the decided locations as well.  
  
\> Keeping these factors aside Youtube and Tik Tok both platforms have high engagement rates with large audiences. So, you will be able to reach a wider and active market via these platforms.  
  
At last, I would suggest you do A/B testing. After analysing & forecasting their performances, optimize it and scale it to get higher ROI for your efforts.
You’re going to want to consider the audience this solves a problem for. Will this make communication easier for the workplace? Is this something an individual can use on a daily basis to help them? You’re going to have different demographics between these platforms (though the gap seems to slowly be shrinking).
YouTube is the 2nd largest search engine on the planet. People can find things they are looking for easily.

Tik tok is built for you to stumble on what you like and keep you there. 

Both are great tools to put your brand in front of a niche. I would say you can play on the text to speech in tik tok better but YouTube may be better for people willing to buy

I'm not so sure that the audience is different now. I see more and more facebook users who spend more time watching tiktok videos than facebook posts
