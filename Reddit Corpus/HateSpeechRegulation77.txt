Title: 21 Tips for Great Social Media Marketing

Post:
**1) Understand Community Vs Growth Features**

When you begin your social media growth, don’t rely alone on Posts (Growth Features) 

The Important part is to keep that community engaged through IG Stories or Comments. (Community Features) 

**2) Distribution is good but how you do matters**

Distributing every platform is like feeding baby portions to 24 years olds. 

Understand platforms and reformat content to make it perform. 

**3) Understand Industry Keywords & Use them**

On social media you find a lot of posts about algorithms because it’s a trending “Industry keyword” used by IG coaches. 

Starting your content research, find them & include in your content. 

**4) Don’t promote products, promote transparency**

Working with Million follower Influencers & selling less than 5 products. Teached that! 

Lack of transparency exists when brands & influencers use viral content & lack transparency. Show more of your business. 

**5) Consistency isn’t taught well** 

Consistency doesn’t mean you have to post everyday. 

It means you have to be consistent with your content style to achieve that 11 consumer touch points to convert them. 

**6) Remember Keywords lead to Hashtags**

Not a single platform shows you posts directly from hashtags section. In reality, Users search keywords that lead them to #hashtags section in search bar. 

Use hashtags that might be people searching for not the ones with many posts. 

**7) Shareable content isn’t good**

Human nature likes to keep good thing. The reasons why you make a recommendation is because you feel good when you make it. 

Shareable content doesn’t ask followers to share because it’s good. They share because they felt included in the post. Are you giving readers that feel? 

**8) Don’t pin Viral Posts** 

Viral Posts can act like Social Proof but 

Remember Viral content targets 100 Different Buyer personas but you need to reach 1 target persona. The one your other marketing team researched on to scale business. 

**9) Social Media Strategy ≠ Content Strategy**

Your Social media strategy helps you to attract your potential customers through different tactics. 

Your content strategy is what you are feeding customers to make them come & buy. 

**10) Make Them Question or Answer First**

Post a Question with no options to choose. If you have a bad connection with audience, you might not even get an answer. 

At that point starting creating polls & questionable connect. To increase the interactivity with your followers. You will find them answering questions where you can pitch your product. 

**11) SPE format to master short form content** 

SPE: Serial Position effect in short form Content teaches how to position your words to keep users hooked. 

First few words of content to create primacy, giving context in between and last few words to create recency effect, leading to CTA. 

**12) Understanding Broad Audiences**

Before understanding your key audiences. To reach more and more people, you need to study your platform. 

Tiktok/ Youtube are People are Coming to consume or are they here to connect with their friends like Instagram. 

Understand the appeal before choosing your key platforms to market! 

**13) Visuality Speaks on Pinterest** 

Recent reports show 90% of platform post doesn’t link to anything & have smaller text. 

It’s an aesthetic oriented platform and you need to become a curator to create boards that overall represent a niche. Pins alone with heavy keyword inputs will not work. 

**14) Clickbait works with AIDA framework** 

While using clickbait you need to story build up to make people reach to the CTA. 

With well-know copywriting framework, catching Attention with clickbait and then fulfilling desire & user interests with your storyline or social media captions or carousels is important. 

**15) More than 1 link decreases conversions** 

Hick’s law states that more choices makes it harder for people to choose. 

The same approach stands for the “link-in-bio tools” they can derive sales away. If you are using too many links, ask yourself are you funnelling your audience into so many links or not. 

**16) DMs are Important because they spy**

I have tread privacy policies of all platforms & even tracked their DM updates. 

Most platforms still don’t have end-to-end encryption for messages, stating if you have a greater connection with your followers. The chances of them viewing their content consistently increases. 

**17) Embed UGC content into your Feeds** 

The more similar brand faces you will have within your social media feeds. 

More personally will the followers connect with you. 

**18) Survive Fast Social Media with Bubble**

Some platforms like Twitter & IG that move fast but don’t provide that same growth they did in 2015-17. 

You have to create a network or creator bubble to keep your engagement rate at a common level for your follower count if it fluctuates with your users liking or disliking. 

This helps to stay on growth track! 


**19) Algorithms moderates, You repurpose**

Tiktok & Instagram are often discredited due to engagement rate falling & rising. The reason is platform being in highlights and constant need to moderate content for different cultures. 

That’s why they use sensitivity control. Content constantly being removed and ranked on platform. If your posts did well in past 90 days ago, don’t hesitate to repurpose it now! 

**20) Formats matter because Attention Span is sinking** 

A new Tiktok trend can put this argument to end. **Family Guy** clips are all over Tiktok with a gaming video attached below because users can’t focus on one thing at once and span is shortened. 

That’s why sticking to aesthetic Imagery & Video formats is a must.

**21) Social Media is more about you connecting rather than Platform.** 

I have talked to employees at most of these platforms, social media is pay to view world. Youtube & Tiktok being Content hub rely on recommending you better content. So, they do provide good reach. 

Others they are first Ads, then trying to connect you with audiences. 

That’s why the best thing is to build an engagement strategy, network & show why they should care.
