Title: Defining 'Hate Speech' Online Is Imperfect Art as Much as Science - "software programs are imperfect tools for assessing the nuances that can distinguish acceptable from unacceptable words or images."

"Hate speech" can not be defined and will always be arbitrary, not to mention that it inherently includes much constitutionally protected and socially necessary speech.
"The road to hell is paved with good intentions" comes to mind.

As long as it is still the case that AI-driven algorithms continue to flag messages as safe when they contain deeply offensive or hateful speech while also still flagging other messages as hateful speech because of the use colorful language (even though no actual hate speech occurs)...

... Then we should not depend on those same algorithms to protect us from hate speech.
The kind of comments it's flagging as toxic are

> They are uninformed or ignorant

>Their opinion, just don't force it down my throat

>I respect them but believe they think I am stupid and only thinking short-term. I believe we don't know what will happen longterm regardless

This is still in development - but this is just one of those bad, bad ideas. A robot nanny that regulates human expression to accord with the values of its creator. Hmm.
The politically-correct decides that for us though speech codes and online bans.  

Forced re-education camps may not be too far off... 
We don't need algorithms and technology to protect us from "hate speech." That's what freedom of speech and robust public debate is for.

Maybe there's a reason why fascism never took hold in a country with robust freedom of speech, and why countries with freedom of speech have enjoyed an almost continuous improvement in human rights and tolerance.
