...why would this be deleted or downvoted?
**Latest:** Also I’m seeing coverage of Tiktok US Ban Hearing with congress going viral. So far Congress is going at Tiktok CEO like they don’t want to give the platform any chances to prove their point. 

The situation is neck to neck for Tiktok. The only way out seems to be end their partnership with Bytedance in China!
Thanks for the update. 

Can anyone shed any light on the new AI regulations on Tiktok? How does that effect creators who, for example,use some AI generated images for lyric videos?
Is that Twitter charging for 2FA? 

Or is that specifically for “verification” in a Twitter Blue sense of the word. Seems wild they would charge for extra security that is currently free there and everywhere else.
