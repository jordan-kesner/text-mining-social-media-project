Title: Guardian exposÃ©: "The Facebook Files" - 100+ LEAKED Facebook training manuals and other documents show guidelines for content moderators on things like violence, hate speech, terrorism, and porn

Post:
This looks like it will do some further damage to Facebook's aspirations to become not just a news-aggregating and sharing platform, but a legitimate stand-alone news outlets alongside CNN and ABC News and the other major ones.

The money, power  and views generated by from such guidelines infinitely outweighs the power of any soon-to-be-forgotten scandal.

The irony is, this story will garner hundreds of thousands of impressions *on* Facebook. 

More ironic still, The Guardian will 100% have their own versions of these guidelines.
Desperation can take many forms. The slow death of traditional retailing and traditional advertising is not embraced by everyone as you can imagine
I am very bullish on Snap. I do not see Facebook Inc. increasing or maintaining its current dominance in the coming years. A few reasons: The redoubled efforts to control content and manage user behavior will backfire; even Forbes noted the foolhardiness of such efforts (see the article below). Snap is not fading away; in fact, just the other day, George Soros himself invested in it--he donated a publicly reported $9M to the U.S. presidential candidate who got the most votes last year. There is also the sheer changes tastes and habits in terms of technology use among teenagers and 20-somethings every several years, along with the changes that happen in popular music, fashion, and hairstyles. In 2007, '08, and '09, Facebook was the hottest thing to be on among high school and college students--and how cool is it today, where parents and grandparents are sharing political images and articles with each other? I don't see Instagram managing to continue dominating, either; the now nearly wholesale copycatting of Snapchat (I'm just waiting for "Instamoji" cartoon characters, a la Bitmoji) is a bad sign, not a good one.

Snap is fading. They'd having a very hard time creating real returns and have yet been able to increase revenue. Their user numbers have stalled and they've failed to pull in people outside the 16-25 age range.

Instagram Stories did in less than 5 months what it took Snap 5 years to attain user-wise. Instagram may be copying Snapchat but it's really hurting Snapchat. They're able to iterate and advance their platform far faster than Snapchat has. Unless something SERIOUSLY changes for Snap, they're headed downhill fast.
I still definitely disagree, and I see that it continues to be the #1 most downloaded Android social app from day to day, ahead of Facebook and Instagram--not a bad position to be in:

I take a long-term view, as only a few very shrewd investors made who bought Facebook early on and held it for 16 months through plenty of bashing in the news media for months upon months, as Facebook IPO'd on May 18, 2012 for $38.23, and it wasn't until August 9, 2013 that it rose about that price, to $38.50. 

You evidently believe that Snap is out of new ideas, and just won't be able to carve out a place for themselves, or that Facebook Inc. will always quickly squash them, look at how much their main product has diversified from year to year: http://i.imgur.com/uVGL5Zg.jpg It's not going to level out or decline from there. The AR Revolution is underway, with the massive and multiple-record-breaking success of Pokemon Go (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go#Downloads_and_revenue), and Snapchat can go in many directions with AR, with online advertising and shopping (as their acquisition Cimagine was an AR ecommerce service), and camera-glasses (just getting started--I'm waiting for ones that can record for 10 minutes at a time), and drones, maybe a Snap phone, and whatever else that I don't know until it's unveiled. 

Quite simply, when the entertainment media (hundreds of celebrities are active every day on Snapchat - here's a list of 153, with many of the most world-famous A-List singers and actresses - http://ew.com/news/2017/03/23/celebrity-snapchat-handles/) AND news media (WSJ and CNBC plugging it every week, and some 20 news outlets having a Snapchat Discover channel) gets behind something as forcefully as they have been, that thing catches on and prevails. There isn't an electoral college when it comes to products, so if Hillary Clinton were an app, then she, with the full-fledged support on the entertainment media (literally over 1,300 celebrities, from footnote 891 to 2,254 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign_non-political_endorsements,_2016#Celebrities) and news media (CNN, NYT, WaPo), obviously captured more market share than the Donald Trump app.




OK bro. Keep believing Snap is going to do amazing things despite the fact they're struggling and have yet to show a return. They're bleeding money and have yet to show they can turn things around. Professional stock traders know nothing and you've got all the answers despite weak information.

Your argument of Pokemon Go is hilarious but well illustrates the route Snapchat is going. Pokemon Go blew up. But then it disappeared nearly as fast. They've lost the vast majority of players and failed to do grow. That's exactly what Snapchat has done too. Their growth has slowed to a crawl and they've failed to bring in much of anyone outside the 16-25 year old crowd, which is the only place they can hope to find real growth at this point.

You cite the fact that some celebrities and media are on Snapchat as some type of big win. The fact is that those same folks are on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram too and they're all more active on those networks and see more engagement outside of Snapchat. 

You're pretty delusional about this whole thing because you have a big Snapchat boner like a 17 year old.

From the Wikipedia link:

Usage of the game peaked on July 15, and by mid September, had lost 79% of its players. Forbes said "the vaguely curious stopped playing and the more committed players ran up against a fairly unsatisfying endgame".[161]  ***-KEEP READING-*** In October 2016, Niantic released a Halloween-themed event, which saw a surge in revenue up to 133% as reported by Sensor Tower, placing the game back to top of the charts of highest grossing apps. It was reported that the game earned approximately $23.3 million between October 25 and 29, up from approximately $10 million between October 18 and 22.[162] ***-KEEP READING-*** By February 2017, the game been downloaded more than 650 million times worldwide, with a reported US$1 billion in revenue made, becoming the fastest mobile game ever to do so.[163][164]

That's "disappearing"?

And each of those platforms has been around for years longer than Snapchat. I'm just stating facts and figures. Call me whatever names you want, whether it's "bro" or "delusional 17-year-old." I remain very optimistic about Snap.
