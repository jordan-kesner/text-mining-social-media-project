Title: Since running for president, Kamala Harris has outlined several policy positions (described in this post) in the several campaign speeches shes given. Will these positions be effective or ineffective in helping her win the election?

Post:
Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

Policy positions were summarized from these campaign speeches:

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

Neutral. She more or less is adopting Biden's platform as she's part of his administration. She'll be more forceful on abortion access and probably play more defense on immigration. But all of this is already baked into the electorate.
If she hadn't it might have lowered some of the enthusiasm from the base, because the Democratic base are very, very into legislation and seeing their causes championed.  They get nervous when their candidate is vague about what causes they are going to champion or what they are going to do in office.

I don't think it will make a difference with any other demographic.   

Most independents who are going to vote for her are going to do so for one reason alone:  She's not Trump. They have their own agendas they'd like to see championed, so this stuff isn't going to entice them.

If Trumps people were going to dump him, they'd have done it long ago because of all the shit he's done.  They are all in and live in their own reality where nothing she says or does really matters.
Not much different than any Democratic positions (which are mostly pretty popular, actually). And polices haven't moved the needle in Presidential elections, for decades. We are too dug into our tribes.

With that being said, there is probably one difference this year. Abortion

It could get a lot of people out to the polls, especially women. And Kamala might be a better spokesperson for it than the typical Democrat.

It's a particular good year to run a woman, for Democrats. It's also a particularly bad year to run two incel-adjacent men for the GOP. A pro-life woman would have been a much better VP candidate for the GOP. A lot of women are pretty sick of being talked down to about Women's issues by men.
I think her focus on the middle class and her positioning of herself as the candidate of and for the middle class is going to be highly popular and effective, especially for turning out independent and suburban votes. With all this talk in the Trump era of the “forgotten America”, and all the talk from both sides about working class issues, it’s refreshing to hear a presidential candidate whose really hitting home their support for the middle class specifically and making that a cornerstone of their campaign. Suburban America will decide this election, and Kamala certainly *feels* like the candidate of and for suburban America
Wait, Harris has policies?

But seriously, these are all extremely boiler-plate democratic policies.  People have been saying for the past year that "generic democrat" polls better than Biden, so she's trying to become Generic Democrat.  It's not like any of these are actual policy prescriptions.  "I support making sure affordable healthcare is available for everyone" is about as vague as she can possibly be. (To be clear, that's exactly the electoral strategy she should be taking right now.)

Harris struggled in 2020 to stand out of the crowd.  She made some frankly wild promises then in an attempt to differentiate herself.  She doesn't have that problem now.  "I'm a totally standard democrat" is a terrible position in a primary, but it's the perfect position in the general. So she has quietly disavowed pretty much everything she said 4 years ago. 

The one exception, obviously, is immigration.  Immigration has long been the democrats' weakest point.  So Harris is trying to nip that in the bud.  There's a great opportunity there with the border bill that Trump personally killed for political points.  She should hammer him on that every time he tries to bring immigration up.
Probably effective at gathering support/votes. The candidates are battling for undecided voters and in my mind entitlements generally win voters over despite having lived through the slowest economic recovery in history and a recession brought upon by a pandemic. Forget about the bill(and quality of service), what do I get?
This could possibly be the most generic vanilla policy platform a Democrat could put forward in 2024. But I guess this election was never going to be about policy anyway. Maybe that’s something we can get back to once trump is finally gone.
The assault weapons ban won’t help her.  It won’t be as extreme as the right makes it sound, it won’t get through congress, and it might not do any good anyway.  

In theory I’m not opposed to it, but I have yet to see a workable proposal.  Although it did work under Clinton to some degree, there are a lot of ARs out there that are not going away.

I haven’t really even seen a good definition of assault weapon.  The gun nuts are right on this detail.
I really appreciate your Edit and furthermore.
It amazes me how little policy perspective we have on Kamala. Without an actual primary and a press that doesn’t seem to care we have very little except ‘vibe’…
That and we know she’s already abandoned stances she very firmly held back when she did primary.
She’s not Trump is good enough for many, but I agree she’s a chameleon (Kamalaleon?).

Unpopular point, given that we know she is prone to change stances (actually perhaps a positive, if she responds to public opinion), has been questioned very little on what she will actually do, and has very much campaigned on her immutable traits- there is some truth to the DEI criticism. We know that her position as VP was in part due to her race and gender, as Biden said he would choose a woman of color before selecting her.
