Center "violated the hate-speech provision of our 
acceptable-use policy,"

>On Facebook, Palin wrote that Jones' planned Quran burning "will feed the fire of caustic rhetoric and appear as nothing more than mean-spirited religious intolerance. Don't feed that fire."

Palin said something that wasn't completely retarded?  Why isn't *this* the headline?
It's interesting that last week all we heard on the "main stream" news was how we should oppose the "Mosque" (a Community Center) 2 blocks away from ground zero, and now they're saying how bad this could be for us if the guy burns the Qur'an... 

Almost the opposite message one week to the next.... got to love the propaganda machines.
I'm planning an "International Test Your Fire Extinguisher" day for 9/11. Kids events will include Super Soaker target games and the water balloon toss.
Freedom of speech arguments are sure to come up, as are common carrier ones, but Rackspace is NOT an ISP, it's a private webhosting company which is entitled to decide not to give these hateful fucks a platform for their free, but horrible, speech.
