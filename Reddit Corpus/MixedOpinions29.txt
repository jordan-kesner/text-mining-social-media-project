Title: CMV: Jordan Peterson doesn't seem so bad.

Post:
I only ask that you please read my post before replying. I want you to understand where I'm coming from and to understand me better as the one asking.

To start, I'm not a "Jordan Peterson follower." I don't talk with people in real life about him and I don't engage with people on Reddit about him. I also consider myself a liberal, though to be fair to you and me, I'm really not all that educated or well-read on politics. I looked at the big differences, found myself agreeing mostly with the left, and settled there.

I first started listening to Jordan Peterson about 3 years ago. I began by searching up lectures on Carl Jung and encountered him on YouTube. It was a lot of fun and I hadn't encountered anything like it up until that point. His videos on meaning and philosophy were very interesting to me. I liked the way he explained things and I was fascinated by the meaning he extrapolated out of movies and books in his lectures. It isn't revolutionary or new, but it was accessible and digestible to me.

After enjoying his lectures and classes, I brought him up to my ex. She liked the first few videos I showed her, but she didn't like how blunt and rude she found him. It took me some time to empathize with her and to understand why she disliked the way he talked, but I never really minded myself. 

Not long after, she googled his name and found his more inflammatory videos:  
"JORDAN PETERSON SHUTS DOWN FEMINIST" and "JORDAN PETERSON OWNS LIBERAL NEWS ANCHOR." After, she found tons of articles criticizing what he was saying in his videos and his book.

You probably won't be surprised that the next time we talked, she was excited to tell me about how terrible he is as a person, how he set transgendered rights in Canada back, and how he's a Nazi sympathizer. It was surprising to me, for sure, and I had to go back and double check. I watched the videos and read the articles criticizing him. 

So I vetted him for myself and I challenged my liking of him. He has a lot of opinions, in politics and otherwise, that I don't agree with. For example: he doesn't seem to think that there's such a thing as white privilege and he does seem to think that the glass ceiling for women is a biological hindrance more than a societal one. He also thinks that being legally forced to use transgendered pronouns will lead the government down some slippery slopes away from free speech. I can't say I agree.

I also tend to dislike his fans as much as the next person. Most people on both sides of the fence, love or hate, make me feel like they heard completely different messages in what he's saying. It's either people saying that he is some radical misogynistic rightwing fascist or people saying he's Jesus' disciple who is here to stop all the abortions and save monogamy, marriage, and alpha males.

Seriously, the videos that people create on YouTube from his lectures are atrocious. I mean absolute garbage. "How to be an Alpha Male - Jordan Peterson" or "Don't Put Swine Before Pearls - Jordan Peterson." And the videos themselves are usually 9 minute clips of him talking about something that doesn't relate at all. I don't get any of that messaging when I listen to his full-length lectures.

In summary, I hear a lot that I think is good in Jordan Peterson's videos. There is a lot about taking responsibility and effecting change in your life through small steps. He tells you to aim for the good and gives steps that I think, if followed accurately, can help someone improve their life gradually yet exponentially. He's said multiple times that he doesn't consider himself outside or above his own advice and has talked in-depth about his own struggles. 

Did I miss the memo? Is he really this radical conservative, Trump supporting, neo-Nazi, alt-right, and incel sympathizing white KKK knight? Or is he just some old professor with some good lectures and also some dated opinions?

I paid some attention to Jordan Peterson when he first came to light with the C16 bill stuff, and kept listening to him up through his 'meat-only' diet that he talked about on the Joe Rogan podcast.

Peterson has a horrible habit of making a whole bunch of observational claims, tie them to a bunch of questions that seem like action-suggestions, but stopping *just* short of making an actual prescriptive claim. THEN when many of his followers (not all) take it the rest of the way, somehow he can claim that he *never* said what they believe.

For example, in his [interview about women in the workplace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9dZSlUjVls), it was **full** of statements about women in the workplace and sexual harassment.

Just listen to the first 60 seconds of this interview. Only the first 60. Then tell me....**what does Jordan Peterson think about women & men in the workplace together**?

>I (Interviewer): "Can women and men work together in the workplace?"  
JP (Jordan Peterson): "**We don't know** if men and women can work together successfully in the workplace"  
>  
>I: "40 years ago...I could have done whatever I wanted, and there would have been almost no recourse that a woman working under me would have - now they have some recourse"  
JP: "There was recourse back then too - **they could go to the police**"  
>  
>I: "So you feel like right now the atmosphere in corporate workplace is the same as it was 40 years ago?"  
JP: "No, but I'm not sure...**not saying that it's any better**"

Okay so it **sounds** like he's saying "we don't know if women and men can work together in the workplace, back in the day women could go to the police if they were harassed, and today it's not any better than it was 40 years ago."

If you go on in the interview, he just continues with these kinds of statements.

Is it surprising that a huge majority of his followers, after hearing this entire interview, think "well, it seems like men and women **can't** work together in the workplace!"

THEN, when asked "what should be done about it?" Jordan NEVER EVER puts the blame on the men. He never EVER says something like "men should understand the perspective women have, and try to empathize with them." Or "men should learn how their actions have consequences, and better themselves."

Instead, he leans on "why do women wear makeup and high heels? To sexualize themselves!" - except...when pressed on "so should women **not** wear makeup in the workplace?" He immediately says "I'M NOT SAYING THAT. I'M NOT SAYING THAT," but then immediately doubles down on it by agreeing that if a woman wears makeup in the workplace, is sexually harassed, and complains about it, [that she's a hypocrite](https://youtu.be/S9dZSlUjVls?t=567).

So...what ARE his proposed solutions? I'll give you a hint...he doesn't make any. He almost never does. He will make observations, then make hypothetical proposals about absurd solutions, but when **pressed** about those solutions, he always backs off of them.

TL,DR: If you ask Jordan Peterson what he thinks about *topic*, he will almost never give an actual, concrete, solution. Instead, he relies on "what if's" and "what about's", but if pressed on them, will back off of them almost immediately (or try to dive deeper into "you just don't understand") - but if you ask his **supporters** what they think on a subject, they take the myriad of statements and questions he makes, to find a solution. This is how you get so many JP supporters who think women shouldn't wear makeup or high heels in the workplace.
He is a self-help guru which is not necessarily bad thing. If his life tips work for you, good for you.

But the second part of his philosophy is more problematic. He keeps hammering on how trying to change the rest of the  world will not make you happy. And there is definitely something in that idea. To not worry about things that you can't change is liberating. Its a prominent theme in the [Zhuangzi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/640565.The_Book_of_Chuang_Tzu), a foundational book of Taoism, and years after I read that book I am still glad it taught me that lesson.

But Peterson represents the dark side of that idea. While there are things about which you can only change your attitude, there is also unnecessary suffering in the world. And Peterson distorts this "don't worry about that which you can't change" into "it is hopeless to try to change any unjustice", which is a message a right wing billionaire like Dennis Prager is all to happy to pay him to broadcast into the world.

And he either does not understand or wilfully misrepresents most of the "marxist postmodern" philosophy he likes to bash so much.
that's a bit of a false dichotomy you set up at the end, there, no?

the truth is that jordan peterson is a person with some very mainstream views and some very idiosyncratic ones, and the idiosyncratic ones are so in ways that are... notable.  one of the things that's notable about them is the ways that they echo the weird spiritualism of some very bad fascist people.  it is not fair to say, as a result, that he is saying and doing the same things as all the things the bad fascist people say and do. but it is at the very least fair to point to it and say that is interesting, and wonder whether it is an accident if he keeps doing it.

so the question is, really, if a guy says 100 things, and 60 of them are inoffensive and common sense and a lot of people get a lot of good out of them, and then 30 are more divisive but certainly not dangerous, and then 10 of them are things like saying that "enforced monogamy" is the solution for when incels run over people because they're "angry at women," do you choose to focus on the fact that he's said mostly things that are anodyne-to-even-broadly-helpful, or do you choose to focus on the fact that some of the things he says are utterly batshit.
>  There is a lot about taking responsibility and effecting change in your life through small steps.

This may sound snide, but it's a serious question: Who the fuck doesn't know this?  Who didn't learn when they were five years old that focusing on a goal and having determination can make it more likely that you'll accomplish that goal?  If this was just his message, no one would talk about him; it's a cliche.

It's the trappings that draw people in, and the trappings are about being a man.  Peterson's fans tend to be very strongly focused on (I'd say obsessed with) masculinity.  It's this focus that draws them to him, because it's a huge part of what underlies his viewpoints.  You can't talk about him without talking about that, because it's why he's a big deal.  

And so the main issue is, his message about this is toxic.  These people believe that Being A Man means you're in a constant state of competition with other men, and it makes them miserable.  The truth is, this competition is *made up*; there is no objective way to rank people so people know how good or bad everyone is.  But instead, Peterson creates this elaborate mythology about how this hierarchy of masculinity actually exists and is necessary and meaningful, and none of it makes any goddamn sense but his fans have a strong desire for this kind of hierarchy to exist, so they latch onto it.

I made the mistake of arguing with a Peterson fan on Twitter a while ago, and the dude started insulting my *jawline*.  He did it over and over, either not noticing or not caring that it left me far more nonplussed than hurt.  This dude is so desperate for some clear way to rank men, he lives in a world where jawlines are something to be insecure about.

Peterson takes these men who are chasing phantoms of objective reasons to not hate themselves, and instead of leveling with them about the fact that those objective reasons don't exist, he tells them "The manliest men are the ones with their shit together."  This helps some of them get their shit together.  It does not solve the underlying problem.

> Did I miss the memo? Is he really this radical conservative, Trump supporting, neo-Nazi, alt-right, and incel sympathizing white KKK knight? Or is he just some old professor with some good lectures and also some dated opinions?

Taking a step back, the really poisonous thing about Peterson isn't his beliefs, it's his arguments.  He is a *terrible* communicator, but he's terrible in a way that actually makes him more successful, because it keeps him from actually taking a clear stand for anything.

His lectures are famously gibberish, but filled with enough bits and pieces of things that sound profound, people assume he must be speaking brilliance.  But the bigger issue is his sneaky argumentation.

Here's one of his favorite tricks: he'll say two facts back-to-back, suggesting they're related but not explicitly saying how.  Then, when people try to reconstruct his argument and, in so doing, reveal it to have very unsavory or unsupportable connotations, he will feign offense about people putting words in his mouth.

For example, "Men and women are different biologically," and "We should not try to intervene in society to change the fact that there are more millionaires who are men than are women."  These, as it is, have nothing to do with one another, so why would he say them both?  He's clearly suggesting that men are * innately superior* to women in ways that make it more likely for them to be very high achievers.  That's the only way to connect those two concepts in a way that makes sense.  But if you try to say that back to him, he'll be appalled about how you could possibly ever think he'd believe such a thing.

He does this *all the time*, and it's part of a bigger issue where, for such a loud person, it's very very hard to get him to plainly say what he believes.  THIS IS DELIBERATE, because if you never plainly say what you believe, then no one can explain why it's wrong.  It's a very common Debate Club trick, and he's a master of it.

But people look at him and think he's this great speaker.  It's this bad example that's the worst thing about him.
So there's two aspects to talk about here:

The first is that what Peterson claims emiprically has to be taken with a grain of salt. The farther he ventures from his specific area of knowledge, the more errors creep in. I remember watching a classroom video of him, where he was talking about gender issues, and he stated: "Because you know what happens when you double the work force - It halves the value of labor!"

As someone with some basic economic knowledge, my brain went "Whathuhwhat?" when I heard that. It's...*very* incorrect. But he said it so certainly, connected to all the other observations of a clearly very bright guy, I was trying to think if maybe *I* was missing something. Nope, it's just that he's not an economist, and he had some sort of assumption in his head that got said along with his other stuff.

Now, that doesn't completely dismantle the ideas in everything else he said, but you have to realize things like that are gonna happen with him, and unless you have knowledge in a field, you might not be aware of when it is happening.

The second aspect to talk about with Peterson is that he touches on some very sensitive issues. I actually would defend him here a bit more. Some of his stuff about being male in modern society, like [this](https://youtu.be/1aY49YU8uBQ) or [this](https://youtu.be/NX2ep5fCJZ8) are things that, as he says, are hitting young men to their core, giving them clarity about things they could never put into words, and, as Peterson talks about, he receives ridiculous amounts of mail and stories from those men telling him how he brought them back from the brink, inspired them to get their lives in order, feel they had self worth, etc.

I don't think that's just good, I think it's a monumental accomplishment. To the extent that's what has skyrocketed him to prominence, he deserves every bit of that.

Now...there is also perhaps a metric fuckton of anger and resentment coming from some of those same men, because no one was telling them these things, but instead they had no understanding of why they were angry and bitter, or the explanations they often got before Peterson just made them *more* angry and bitter. This is where a lot of the "VIDEO: PETERSON DESTROYS WOKE FEMINIST MORON" stuff comes from. 95% of his supporters may not like titles like that, but it only takes a really motivated 5% to post all his stuff and make you see it all the time. 

I think, as Peterson himself has suggested, we currently live in a society that's deeply suspicious of men and their actions. Men are dangerous rapist patriarchal oppressors, and so if someone is giving them some esteem, they might be on the side of evil, and we should be suspicious of everything they say as the work of a secret misogynist bad guy. I don't think there's nearly as much to that. As with everything, people take some ideas and expand them and take them out of context, and you often can't blame the original source, who said something different than people took from it. So, I think Peterson is mostly 'innocent' there. 

OTOH, when he talks about Nietzsche, there are philosophy academics cringing a lot of the time.
I dont get where the nazi description comes from. He has said a million times that totalitarian governments (right and left) and ideologies are bad.  He always talks about the sovereignty of the individual. ALL individuals, not white individuals or individuals that are men. I have watched many of his lectures/interviews and there is nothing that suggests that he is a white suprematist and/or racist.

Also to my knowledge, he has never supported trump explicitly. He is just against the radical left at the moment because they are dominating universities (he is a professor).

The videos titled "peterson destroys x" are not made by him. Its just click bait titles. They hurt his image more than anything.

He also said that the primary factor of the emancipation of women was technological improvements. Thats debatable, but certainly isnt a good enough reason to call him a misogynist.
Jordan Peterson is sort of a complicated figure. First off, he is very intelligent but he tends to overplay his hand and get involved in areas where he has no or little expertise. When it comes to psychology, he definitely knows what he is talking about (being a professor and whatnot). A lot of his views are very nuanced and sophisticated, especially his theological views. 

Probably one of the worst criticisms of Jordan Peterson is that no one is quite sure what he said or meant. This is in part because he leads on the people he is discussing with so that they will assume he said something extreme then walk it back to make them look bad by explaining he meant something completely different and mundane.

The problem with this is that he "opens the doors" for actual extremists, without going in himself. Portions of his audience who actually hold the extreme positions he suggests but doesn't actually have will jump on his words as proof of their correctness while those who actively oppose those views are left with no real recourse against him.

At the end of the day, I don't think that Jordan Peterson is a terrible person with terrible views, but his cohorts are the worst. People frequently take him out of context, or don't fully understand him because of the IQ disparity. Then again, if no one knows just what you said, did you really say anything at all?
