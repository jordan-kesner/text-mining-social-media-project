Stolen pictures being spread in that group. Facebook won't shut it down. The pictures that are accidentally posted as Public (or automatically) are changed to Friends only.

What is that group? Google translate was useless when trying to translate the group description, and I can't see any of the content because I'm not a member.

ETA: They're posting photos other people originally posted as "Public" on FB? What are they doing with the photos, making fun of the people in them?
Yes and bashing them. They are stealing other's profile picture without their and my permission.

It's like an Offensive groups that has no rules and turned into a hateful toxic unfriendly environment unlike other offensive groups.
How immature and nasty of the people doing that. I'm sorry they've done that to you & everyone else they've bashed. 
Some groups like Viral Dirty Memes Group captures are good because they share other's comments and show them to others with a non-hate speech bullying context because the admins are working hard to prevent it from happening like the bashing part where people steals profile picture and make fun out of it. The admins in that group just wants the 10k people in that group adding anyone in the group who joins in. It's not a friendly group and many leaves and just joins on the other IC group because of the friendly environment with no fake accounts.

How ever the IC group is very toxic and should not be on Facebook.
