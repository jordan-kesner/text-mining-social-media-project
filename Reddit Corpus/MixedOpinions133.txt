Title: I don't think religious views/practices deserve any greater legal deference or protection than secular views/practices. CMV.

Post:
I know this sounds like (okay, is) a circlejerky topic for reddit, but it's a minority view in society at large and, out of curiosity, I'd like to try to see the other side.

When I talk about legal deference and protection accorded to religion, here are two prime examples that come to mind:

* **Free exercise clause**.  In the United States, you have a fundamental constitutional right to free religious exercise -- a right given so much deference that any laws which fail to accomodate your religion must satisfy the same "strict scrutiny" standard as, say, laws that blatantly restrict speech or enact overt racial classifications.  I can see good reasons for a constitutional framework discouraging government censorship or government racism, and can also see good reasons for the *establishment clause* of the First Amendment (which prevents the government from endorsing, promoting or discouraging any *particular* religion).   But I see no special value in having the government go out of its way to "accomodate" otherwise-regulable conduct just because that conduct carries a religious vs. a secular imprimatur.  If I want to smoke peyote for personal or cultural reasons, and you want to smoke it for religious reasons, we should be treated equally by the government.   If I want to deprive my child of medical treatment for the lulz and you want to deprive your child of medical treatment for religious gratification, we should both have our children taken away from us.  


* **Workplace discrimination laws.**   As an employer, if I'm a rabid Mets fan and want to fire all the Yankee fans, or if I have total contempt for Stephanie Meyer and want to fire all the Twilight fans, I'm free to do so.  If I fire all the Koran fans, I can be sued.  I don't see any good justification for this disparity.  I suppose you could argue that religious discrimination often intersects with other types of discrimination, such as racial discrimination -- but that doesn't mean the two are inseparable or synonymous.  If I'm free to dictate style of dress, workweek schedules and other aspects of my nonreligious employees' lives, there's no reason religious employees should receive special protection.  If religious antidiscrimination provisions were eliminated, it's of course true that religious employers could openly discriminate against nonreligious employees.  But if your boss can already fire you for pretty much any reason, including a failure to share his subjective tastes or preferences in other areas.  We no longer live inthe 1700s, and there's no reason religion ought to be special.  

Finally, I expect someone will make the argument that these laws are beneficial because religion has, throughout history, proven to rile people up in a uniquely potent way, and that by according some moderate deference to religion we prevent religious zealots from getting alienated, going underground, and festering into something even worse.  This is a fine argument, but I'm more curious to see arguments that share, and convincingly defend, the prevailing societal view that religion *is* special and worthy of deference/respect (versus arguments along the lines of: "oh just throw them a bone and pretend they're special so they don't run off and become terrorists.")

If you're talking about a prevailing societal view, then what more reason do you need other than religion being a prevailing societal view?

It's considered important by society, because society is nothing more than people, and most people (in the U.S., which I assume you're talking about) consider religion uniquely important to their world views. 

In a majority-religious democractic state, one has to ask which would be preferred: a theocracy (which is what you would normally get in a majority religious democracy), or one that respects people's religious beliefs and gives them deference, without prefering them?

Those seem like the only choices if you're going to have a democracy.
Simply put, it's because religion isn't your Mets fandom, or your Stephenie Meyer contempt. It's not a clothing style, nor is it a favorite band. Sure, some people treat it like that, but that's not what religion is.

I'm going to assume you are an atheist, although I certainly could be wrong, but if you truly believed there was strong, compelling, undeniable evidence for the Christian God (and you didn't believe he was a tyrant, or whatever), wouldn't you become a Christian? Wouldn't that become just as much a part of your identity as your race, your gender, or any other thing you were born with? It isn't fair to compare religion to a Met's fandom because one is a hobby, or even an obsession, while the other is a fundamental part of your identity, something that's not going to change. One isn't simply a "fan" of the Koran. One isn't simply a "fan" of God. Christians are not fans - they are followers. People have written entire books and even [made videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiB6tCiVfu4) on the subject.

So comparing it to a fandom, or a hobby, simply isn't correct. A more logical comparison would be to racial discrimination. Additionally, you have to think about the impact of free exercise laws on those they are affecting. Say you are a kid with a wine habit - if the government stops you from drinking wine, boo hoo. Sure, it's sad, especially if you were responsible, but it's not a big deal. Now say you're a kid who truly believes that drinking wine and eating bread makes him closer to God, a being who he believes he should worship, love, and honor. Take away his wine and one has much more cause to be angry. You are stopping him from communing with God, and in some cases maybe increasing his chances of going to a very hot place. I'm not going to address the deprivation of medical treatment because I agree with you there, but I will point out it is a very different case - one sip of wine a week is not going to do a thing to a child. If it was getting drunk, sure, get the government involved. But if it isn't harmful, then there is no reason for the government not to allow it considering the alternative.

I think the problem essentially lies in viewpoints. Although somewhat up to interpretation, most would tell you that religion is not something you can choose -any more than you can "choose" to believe the keyboard in front of you exists. To discriminate against an entire group of people on the basis of their religion makes just as much sense as discriminating against a group of people because of their race - neither can really be chose, and thus both are outlawed.
While I agree with you OP, what would you say if I said the inverse: that I don't think some secular views/practices deserve any *less* legal deference or protection than religious views or practices?
You do realize the precedent you're setting though. Basically you're enshrining a single ideological basis, and saying that ANYONE who disagrees more or less has no right to own a business without compromising themself. Is this level of authoritarianism really worth the minuscule positives that most people easily know how to subvert anyways?
I depends on what the definition of "religion" is, and I think that in this sense it is usually defined too narrowly.  Religion is a set of beliefs that are important enough to deserve these kinds of sanctions, and the sanctions are reserves for religious beliefs. Its circular. The mistake is the belief that a religion must have supernatural aspects to it. But even under the very broadest definition, I don't think sports fandom could ever be called a religious belief. For one thing, there is no reason to believe that you or the world would suffer because you can't root for the Mets the way you want to.
You have the entire concept of religious freedom backwards. It's in the constitution, not to give religious people privelage, but to protect them from government instrusion. I'm not going to debate on what morals/religion America was founded on. But it's historically corroborated that America WAS founded, initially, because the King of England restricted the way they were able to worship, to fit his need. The Pilgrims came here so God could be what they wanted him to be.

When it comes to certain aspect of your life, the government either controls it, or they don't. They either protect free exercise, or they don't. And since the Constitution dictates it is protected, in order to prevent the government from stepping in and outlawing certain beliefs (which would be very bad for atheists), they will and should continue to protect it.

Trust me. Look around the world. Any government that DOESN'T protect free exercise is a horrible place to be if you don't believe in the "State religion." Atheists included. I assure you are far better off the way things are to believe what you want.
Try to shift your perspective a bit on this.  I know you see religion as a choice, but most religious people never had any choice in the matter.  These people were lied to, by their parents/family, about religion since they were old enough to understand words.  I've seen 1st hand what thorough indoctrination can do to a person's mind and it is quite disturbing.  These people are psychologically damaged and IMO not responsible for their beliefs as they no longer have the ability to think because their minds were crippled when they were children.  Unfortunately, the only path this argument can lead now is to the-

>"oh just throw them a bone and pretend they're special so they don't run off and become terrorists."

-But I hope this may adjust your perspective towards the religious in general.

But our government *does* prefer religious over nonreligious views, as religious views get accorded deference that secular views do not.  

If you have a bunch of people, the majority of whom observe one religion or another, and they want to form a democracy, your options are not limited to: (i) a theocracy where private behavior is policed to conform to religious norms or (ii) a democracy where private behavior gets generous deference so long as that behavior is religious in nature.  There is also a third option -- you could have a neutral democracy where private behavior within certain spheres gets respected no matter what, even if it's nonreligious.

That is the state of affairs I'd prefer.
