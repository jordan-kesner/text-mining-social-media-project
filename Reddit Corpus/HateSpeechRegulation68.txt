Thanks for the comprehensive list. This one might be the most insanely stupid thing I've ever heard of:

 • Twitter will limit 2FA Feature to Twitter Blue Subscribers only from March 20,2023.
Tik Tok just doesn’t hit like it used to. Have an account with 100k followers and the content barely gets shown to those people. I like IG’s model where it shows the videos to your followers first and then pushes it in the explore feed days and weeks after.
Social media application will be registered to one person and will be locked and unlocked through facial recognition, finger, and eye to verify age. This will prevent bots and increase security. As one registered owner. Parents will help children create an account which will be monitored by parents. Notifications of friend request, view texts and pictures trough mirroring application sending it to the parent for approval. Inappropriate messages or images will be sent to the parent using blurred distortion removal. Posts from your follower or whom you follow will be a selected feature where you can add or remove unwanted posts or pictures but still engage. Media page will act as your own personal website for selling of goods. Recognized images will be available for shopping and selling. Opt in or out to view marketed goods that are displayed. If you like that shirt you can simply press and hold adding to cart. Checkout will verify using facial recognition. Eye monitoring for mood analysis. Application will respond to mood, sleep, excitement, fear, depression, or anger. Application will time out and give recommendations for appropriate actions. Such as therapy or rest. Camera will have barcode reader functionality.
Twitter will prob store the passwords in plaintext. Have the website compromised and then Elon blamed people for not paying for 2FA.
I understand things change with what gets traction on the app and all that, but good god even if I take a video of my wall for 3 seconds a fraction of my 100k followers should see it. 

I feel like it’s going to be the downfall of the app, a lot of large creators that I talk to are getting frustrated. Your followers mean nothing on there.
