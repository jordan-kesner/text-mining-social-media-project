Honestly, is LinkedIn even relevant anymore?    

The only thing I use it for is to browse profiles and look for experts in certain fields. The news feed and alerts are an absolute fucking dumpster fire.
Great stuff as ever. Thanks for taking the time to put it all together. And hoping to start receiving your newsletter this coming Sunday onwards. :)
