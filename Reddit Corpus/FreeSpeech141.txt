How the duck did this even get to the SC? If ignorance of the law is no excuse then “I couldn’t afford to pay to know about the law” certainly should be. This should’ve been immediately dismissed.
If someone finds a difference in the 2 documents, and argues in court against the state that the unannotated version is what is legally binding, Georgia is going to be cool with that?


"Georgia's lawyer countered that the law wasn't hidden behind a paywall—at least not the legally binding parts. LexisNexis offers a free version of Georgia's code, sans annotations, on its website.

But that version isn't the official code. LexisNexis' terms of service explicitly warns users that it might be inaccurate. The company also prohibits users from scraping the site's content. If you want to own the latest official version of the state code, you have to pay LexisNexis hundreds of dollars. And if you want to publish your own copy of Georgia's official code, you're out of luck."
I feel like copywriting a law should be encouraged. Why would the government not want people to spread knowledge of the laws on their own dime?
The South and really most states have all kinds of anti-democratic holdovers from when they were oligarchies.

Pay to know what the fuck the rules are is just a hilariously blatant version.
That's not the sort of "anti democratic" stronghold being referenced. The states in general but the South especially were essentially run by the old boys clubs.
