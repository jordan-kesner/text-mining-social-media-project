Modern youth are nothing like that of the 60s and no amount of propaganda will get them away from their keyboards.

The CIA wants to manipulate social media in order to create civil unrest and facilitate "regime change" in countries that won't cooperate with central banks and the petrodollar. Who needs exploding cigars anymore when you can just hack someone's news feed?
People need to start loading their accounts with BS. Do a search for lesbian bestiality, how much dick can one take up the ass, how to be a good christian, etc. It's hard to put together good data based on inaccurate information.
