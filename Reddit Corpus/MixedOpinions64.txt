Title: CMV: The ideals of Freedom of Speech and Right to Not Be Offended can not coexist

Post:
Nowadays, a lot of people believe that someone should be punished for what offends them, an infringement of their Right to Not Be Offended: incorrect pronoun usage, opposing (typically extreme) political views etc. A lot of other people would argue that this is an infringement upon their freedom of speech: 'You do you, but I don't have to agree with it or protect you'.

I believe that these two ideals cannot simultaneously be achieved, and one must be emphasised more than the other. In my opinion, Freedom of Speech is a priority in a democracy, but I can empathise with others who think others should be censored if they may cause offence. However, something that I can't understand is how both of these can exist together - surely we either have to censor people to protect those who don't want to be offended, or cause offence to people as a result of letting everyone say what they want.

How can these two rights exist together?


Edit for clarification: By a 'Right to not be offended', I was talking about what some people believe they are entitled to. A lot of people think they are entitled to not get offended, this CMV is attempting to challenge these people.

Punished how? Very few people believe that someone should be jailed for saying offensive things. But if, for example, a person's racist tirade goes viral and their identity becomes known, their employer may choose to fire them to make it clear to the public and their customers that the business does not share those offensive views.

Your right to free speech doesn't protect you from possible social consequences and criticism. And those are the two routes that people who oppose offensive speech usually take.
To paraphrase XKCD, there is a middle ground between taking responsibility for the thoughts and feelings of every individual on earth and covering your eyes and ears while yelling logically correct statements into the void.

Freedom of speech and right not to be offended are two seperate and non opposed concepts. 

Freedom of speech is "right to say". Right not to be offended is "right not to listen".

Unfornutately, those meanings often get twisted. Freedom of speech becomes "people have an obligation to listen to me without being offended". Right not to be offended becomes "people have an obligation to share everything they say with me and none of it should offend me"

When, those two twisted definition clashes, well you get Reddit. 

More reasonable people would do the following. Ask what the speaker means, clear any miscommunication, argue the point, if consensus cannot be achieved walk away or pause the conversation for a bit. The free speaker and the offended can cooperate and make it less unpleasant for both of them until they can leave. 


There is no "Right to Not Be Offended." It is not an ideal right, because it just gives a heckler's veto to the most sensitive person in the room. 

The U.S. was founded on the fundamental principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Not the attainment of happiness, that is not a right, just the pursuit. If something makes you unhappy, it is not violating your rights. If you think your unhappiness is a valid basis for infringing on someone else's liberty, you are mistaken.
I don't think anyone worth listening to seriously believes in ”the right to not be offended". This seem like a straw man against a variety of views that aren't necessarily connected, like people who think people should not say mean things even if they technically have the right to,  people who think harassment should be illegal, people, etc. These things aren't infringements is free speech.
In [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/8jw0fc/cmv_the_ideals_of_freedom_of_speech_and_right_to/dz2vsmq/) you clarified that you mean that social backlash cannot coexist with freedom of speech.

Do you include public criticism of speech in this, e.g. in the media? Wouldn't that be just more free speech?

Objecting against speech is also speech: if you allow one, you need to allow the other.

They can definitely coexist. Freedom of speech is a right that protects us from state censorship, criminal prosecution for our speech, and other state-sponsored legal retaliation. As long as the "right not to be offended" people don't deploy the machinery of the state in their oppression of speech, the rights aren't in conflict at all. If someone is offended by opposing political views, they can still:  publicly humiliate or shame the other person or institution, refuse to be friends with them, boycott them, basically bring any and all social pressure to bear in defense of their "right not to be offended" without ever implicating actual free speech protections. It isn't illegal to say the n word in the US; we've driven its usage into the ground using social means. That's how people protect their right not to be offended while still respecting free speech. 
Freedom of Speech means the government shall not in any way restrict your speech.  This does not mean your speech is free from social consequences. To restrict negative backlash to offensive speech is tantamount to an actual government restriction on speech.

Think it through.  How would you enforce a restriction against social repercussions against speech?  That would require restricting protest, outrage, and social pressure.  All of those are speech that is protected by the First Amendment. 

Finally, nobody asserts you don't have a First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Instead, people who fight against Hate Speech support severe social consequences for bigotry.  This is fundamentally different than a restriction on freedom of speech: it's an entirely protected use of freedom of speech in response to other speech.

Lastly, as a side note, not all speech is protected.  There exists the Fighting Words Doctrine and the Clear and Present Danger Doctrine, as ruled by the Supreme Court. Ifwords have a substantial certainty in the context they are being used to incite violence, they are not protected.  When it comes to Hate Speech in particular, even the conservative wing of the Supreme Court is divided. Read *Black v. Virginia*'s dissent by Clarence Thomas. 
AHH YEA! 

I am SO ready to answer, this!! 

Language is tricky because it's takes on two jobs. (a) *language = oppressive* Calling somebody a "cunt" limits her freedom and agency.  It places her in a relationship and identity she have no control over.  (b) *Language = freedom* The ability to call yourself "woman", or even "cunt" is the freedom to bring yourself into linguistic existence. To summarize:  language performs a "double duty". It allows you to be called an offensive name (aka limits you) but also allows you to name yourself  (aka gives you freedom). 

These things seem contradictory, but in fact they're two sides of the same coin! The only way that we can move forward from a hateful words is if we have the freedom to resignify those same words into something meaningless, or even empowering! The word queer is a good example. It used to be an insult that would get you killed. Stormy Daniels' Twitter feed is another good example. If twitter banned "slut" and "whore" Daniels couldn't use those words to make fun of men trying (and failing) to slut-shame her.  The space where we're vendable to hate speech is exactly the same space where we're the most free, because can take those hateful words and use them to reinvent ourselves in empowering ways.  

As a side not, this has to do with *"free speech"* as the legal right for people to say any hateful thing they want. Conservatives seem very confused between *"freedom of speech"* and *"freedom to say hate speech without people getting offended or angry by it".* 

So yes, I will go to the grave defending your right to call transgendered people "trannies", call me a "cunt", or misgender my friends on purpose, but I'm still judging you as a terrible person. The backlash against offensive terms is  actually *"freedom of speech"* in it's most pure form.  It's  gay/ non binary/ transgendered people using their own "free speech" to change the social (not legal) reality of the world they live in.
