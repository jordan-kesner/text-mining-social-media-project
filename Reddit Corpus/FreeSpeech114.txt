Title: Just some clarification about New Zealand's censorship laws

Post:
Heya guys, I have seen a lot of controversy about our government's and police force's attempts at removing the manifesto/video (especially among Americans, I've observed), in regards to how it opposes the U.S.' First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech. Given that the Internet isn't under anyone's jurisdiction, I can see why it's cause for debate.

However, that said, I feel that there's been a lot of misconceptions cropping up about how our 'objectionable materials' and censorship laws work and that there may be a few peeps around who aren't aware of the specific laws we're referencing. I tried to respond to a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/b2d8g9/new_zealand_government_threatening_citizens_with/eiy64s3/) on the subject, but it's not letting me post a reply to the original thread because my account's newish.

>Disclaimer:  
>  
>I can't exactly claim to be an expert on the matter because I've never worked in censorship and I'm just a private citizen, but I have discussed the broader issue (i.e. the content of the manifesto, Trump's comments on white supremacy, the cultural environment in New Zealand at the moment, the shooter's motivations, etc.) at great length with my mother. My mother's a lawyer/policy analyst with over twenty years of legal expertise and experience to draw from, and she's edited and written a lot of legislature in her time. Her specific legal background also gives her some small amount of expertise with human rights and privacy legislature (she worked pro bono for Amnesty International as a legal advisor and she helped to secure the acquittal and release of an Algerian citizen detained in New Zealand on suspicion of colluding with terrorists), which is relevant in this case, because the human rights acts are the primary pieces of legislature being used by the government and police in their efforts to remove the materials.

When my mother and I were discussing the topic of censorship and I brought up how I'd noticed the contention I've noticed on social media (not just on Reddit, but also on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and other places of that ilk), she seemed to be under the impression that the government had several motivations for attempting to 'censor' the materials and that it's most likely not solely due (and arguably, not due) to 'an authoritarian push without precedent'.

To clarify, she referred to several clauses in:

1. **The Bill of Rights Act 1990** \- Freedom of speech isn't protected by common law here in New Zealand, but Section 14 entails the freedom of expression as here: "Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and opinions of any kind in any form."
2. **The Common Law Tort of Invasion of Privacy** \- the tort says that while filming people in a public space without their consent is generally legal, there was several provisions outlined [here](https://nzlaw.co.nz/news/how-private-is-private-when-taking-photos-in-a-public-place/) and [here](http://www.medialawjournal.co.nz/?page_id=275). My mother said that while churches, mosques and other houses of worship are public areas, the common law affords these places 'a sense of privacy'. This 'sense of privacy' being that houses of worship are places for their clergymen to observe their religious beliefs in their own personal space, so the tort exists to protect their congregation and allow them to observe their religious beliefs privately and safely, which is a constitutional and human right, because religion is legally protected in New Zealand. She also said that as the victims were in a place where they could "expect privacy" (because it is a house of worship and it was Friday prayers), it was illegal for them to be filmed when they were both unaware of being filmed and had not consented to it. She also said that he had no legitimate justification to be filming in the mosque in the first place (when you disregard the despicable actions he took there), which is another provision to this tort. Under the principles of the common law tort, it's also illegal to film people when they're in noticeable distress and it's illegal to film "traumatic or humiliating footage at an accident or crime scene".
3. **The Human Rights Act 1993** \- she referred specifically to [Section 21](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/60.0/DLM304475.html), [Section 61](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/60.0/DLM304643.html) and [Section 131](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/60.0/DLM305478.html). Section 21 discusses the legal grounds of infringements against human rights and what is protected by the law. Section 61 and Section 131 discuss 'racial disharmony', hate speech and the distribution of hate speech. Now, to raise a particularly important point on the freedom of speech (which is a right under The Bill Of Rights Act 1990) and hate speech - Section 61 (Racial Disharmony) stipulates that hate speech is ***illegal*** in New Zealand. It's not protected under the right to freedom of expression (our equivalent to freedom of speech) because it is acknowledged as a limitation on freedom of speech due to how it infringes on the human and constitutional rights of other citizens and residents. Though, it goes without saying these laws apply to everyone on New Zealand territory.

I'll elaborate on the specific laws on 'objectionable materials' and censorship of any such materials as best as I can further down, but I'll also address the questions that were raised in the original thread as well.

`1) Is prison time cruel/unusual punishment? Put the idea that it is censorship aside for this question, and pretend that it is a legitimate crime, rather than backlash due to emotional turmoil.`

From what I've seen so far of people being prosecuted/charged for the distribution of the video, this hasn't strictly been the case.

The [people](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/03/18-year-old-arrested-in-new-zealand-for-sharing-terrorists-facebook-video/) [who](https://abcnews.go.com/ABCNews/zealand-man-22-arrested-allegedly-distributing-video-mosque/story?id=61742270) [have](https://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/woman-arrested-facebook-post-after-mosque-shooting) [been](https://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/kiwis-lose-jobs-watching-sharing-mosque-shooting-video) publicly acknowledged to have been arrested for distributing the video (which is legally defined as 'objectionable material' here) haven't been charged solely for distributing it - they've also been faced with additional charges, namely for inciting racial disharmony and violence, which fall under the jurisdiction of the Human Rights Act 1993. So, they're not being charged solely for distributing illegal material but also because they breached human rights, and that's probably the more serious charge placed against them (inciting racial disharmony and violence is more likely to be prosecutable via serving a prison sentence because a prison sentence is one of the possible penalties). While these charges of distributing objectionable material (if you're found to be undeniably guilty) can result in being given a prison sentence, it is not commonly the case. As shown in [Section 123](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0094/latest/DLM314143.html?search=ts_act_classification_resel&p=1) and [124](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0094/latest/DLM314148.html?search=ts_act_classification_resel&p=1) of the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993, the penalties most commonly used are very hefty fines (up to $10,000 for an individual and $30,000 for a corporation). A prison sentence is only ever given when someone has violated Section 124.

So, here's the first common misconception - when people have been reading about prison sentences used as a penalty regarding the distribution of objectionable materials, they've assumed that the prison sentence is given out on the basis that the materials were distributed, which is not the case. However, as shown above in Section 124, the prison sentence is only provided as a penalty upon conviction when someone has ***knowingly*** committed an offence against the act (i.e. they knew the content was objectionable and distributed it anyway). Ergo, you'll go to prison when you've chosen to break the law. Even so, I have rarely ever heard of any case where a prison sentence has been enforced as opposed to a fine.

It's hard to say if the person who distributed multiple copies at the onset of the mosque shooting was actually aware if they were distributing objectionable materials or not (i.e. if they even knew that they were objectionable), but what's definitely certain is that ***he will only be serving a prison sentence if it is indisputably proven he was aware it's objectionable***. It's more likely he'll be fined.

It's also important to point out that if you unknowingly or accidentally gain access to the material, you won't be prosecuted, provided that you don't distribute it further upon realising it's objectionable.

tldr; Prison time is only provided as a punishment under one specific clause under the act and only when someone knows the materials are illegal and choose to distribute them anyway. Fines are more common.

`If any New Zealanders are here can they point us to a law on the books, or any case law that dictates this is not simply an authoritarian push with out precedent to keep people from viewing media the government doesn't like?`

Yes, because as stipulated in our human rights laws, the distribution of the video infringes on peoples' human rights and their rights to privacy due to its inherent nature. As it's a publication material that propagates hate speech and incites violence and racial disharmony, (which is implicitly illegal in New Zealand and other territories too), it's not protected by any legislature relating to freedom of speech here.

`Our stance is that it is freedom of press/information to be able to view the video. Will some people want to see it because they are edgy? Yes. Will some people make jokes, or propaganda with it? Yes. These are not reasons to imprison people for wanting to see what happened on the day.`

Short answer - when someone uses the First Amendment (which is essentially an umbrella that covers freedom of press, freedom of information and freedom of speech, among other things) to support their argument of keeping the video online, you are enforcing and referencing U.S. law on the Internet, which is under international jurisdiction. I feel that this may be hypocritical, because this is the same principle that people are criticising our government and our police force for (i.e. for enforcing our laws in an international space). Given that the video was: (a) not filmed in the U.S. or on any territories under U.S. jurisdiction, (b) was not solely distributed through U.S. owned servers (and, in fact, would've initially been livestreamed on a NZ-based server and ISP, so it most likely reached your servers illegally) and (c) filmed citizens and residents of New Zealand in ***our country*** who were under the observance of ***our laws*** at the time of the mosque shooting. I fail to understand how people can see the logic of applying U.S. legislature here. For one, they don't apply to an international space not under the U.S.' jurisdiction and because the video was illegally sourced, I don't feel that it should be a protected material. It's not a U.S.-produced material, nor is it or under U.S. jurisdiction in any way, it should not be protected under its laws. You could possibly compare it to the distribution of pirated films, if you wanted to use another analogy. Just because a pirated film exists on the internet, it doesn't mean it's legal for it to remain there, because it being there in the first place is illegal.

So, that said, surely it bears little to no relevance to be using U.S. legislature in this instance?

Given that many other countries, especially in Europe and Australia, share similar laws to New Zealand regarding the propagation of hate speech, I doubt that they can justify keeping the video on their ISPs or servers on the grounds of free speech either. It would be desperately unethical on their part.

Now, further to the point, I'm going to clarify on what 'objectionable materials' means. I've seen a few instances on Reddit and other social media platforms that the police and government pick and choose what and what isn't 'objectionable'. Nope, that is a misconception. What's objectionable is laid out in the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993, people can't pick and choose what objectionable materials are on their own whims, that's not how it works. It has to be based on legal justifications outlined in this act.

Pulling directly off the Department of Internal Affairs' [webpage](https://www.dia.govt.nz/Censorship-Objectionable-and-Restricted-Material), the grounds for how objectionable material is defined are as so:

>In deciding whether a publication is objectionable, or should instead be given an unrestricted or restricted classification, consideration is given to the extent, degree and manner in which the publication describes, depicts, or deals with:  
>  
>**acts of torture, the infliction of serious physical harm or acts of significant cruelty**  
>  
>sexual violence or sexual coercion, or violence or coercion in association with sexual conduct  
>  
>sexual or physical conduct of a degrading or dehumanising or demeaning nature  
>  
>sexual conduct with or by children, or young persons, or both  
>  
>physical conduct in which sexual satisfaction is derived from inflicting or suffering cruelty or pain  
>  
>exploits the nudity of children, young persons, or both  
>  
>**degrades or dehumanises or demeans any person**  
>  
>**promotes or encourages criminal acts or acts of terrorism**  
>  
>**represents that members of any particular class of the public are inherently inferior to other members of the public by reason of any characteristic of members of that class being a characteristic that is a prohibited ground of discrimination specified in the Human Rights Act 1993.**

Through these guidelines, it means that snuff films and child pornography are illegal here on the grounds of being a breach to constitutional and human rights. In the case of this video, it promotes terrorism, murder and it incites violence and hate speech/racial disharmony, which is reason enough for the material to be objectionable, but it also breaches the protections afforded by common law and human rights.

So, yes, given the content of this video, ***it is abso-fucking-lutely objectionable***. It is undeniably and indisputably illegal. It is definitely not protected by freedom of expression, and therefore is not protected to any of our legislature regarding freedom of press or information.

`In another post made by someone, they raise a very good point about how being able to view the footage keeps misinformation from being held to scrutiny. If the video is unwatchable by the New Zealanders they will be unable to tell if what the MSM is saying is true. This will open up doors for them to use it for their own propaganda purposes.`

This question is grounded on the assumption that our media operates on the same morals, codes and systems as the American media does. That doesn't work well as a principle when you attempt to apply it to New Zealand media, our media holds itself to different principles and ethics in accordance to the law.

Given that this video is not the main and sole resource available to the public regarding this abhorrent act of genocide, I personally disagree with this sentiment. There are multiple eyewitness accounts, footage of police arresting the suspect, lists of identified victims, and social media announcements provided by the police, our government, and our prime minister. Hell, if you want, you can read the manifesto.

While you could argue that the video is of social and political significance, one of the grounds stipulated in the First Amendment, I don't really see how it is. Yes, it portrays the event in question from a first-person perspective, but the portrayal of meaningless violence and slaughter doesn't put across any agenda except one of hatred, it doesn't offer anything truly valuable or meaningful. If you want a commentary or to understand his motivations, read his manifesto (the manifesto is also objectionable but to a far lesser degree and it does not breach the common law). There is a need for transparency, but it should be less important than the need for people to be protected from further victimization. These people have already suffered enough, it is extremely cruel to try and further it.

While it is a valid point that removing the video could result in a Streisand Effect, other factors have to be put in consideration. For one, I think that affording the risk of a Streisand Effect occurring is much safer and easier on one's conscience than chancing a copycat killing (it has been proven many times that when the media propagates footage and photographs from crime scenes, that it has motivated copycats), furthering and encouraging the propagation of white supremacy and racist ideologies and also blatantly disrespecting the human and constitutional rights of the victims. The chances of a copycat killing taking place due to the Streisand Effect is palpably lesser. Besides, I don't know why the fuck any normal, cogent being would ever try to seek out this footage if they even have an inkling of the contents.

We also have [something](https://www.dia.govt.nz/Official-Information-Act-requests) similar to your freedom of information act, a right we've held since 1982. When the trials have concluded, any member of the public can access the judicial and governmental documentation within reason. The government or the police are not allowed to withhold information from us or perpetuate an inaccurate agenda unless it's within reason (e.g. if it is a matter of national security or something along those lines) or if it breaches any personal privacy provisions as outlined in the Privacy Act 1993. To give an example of when they once breached this law, our government got into deep shit when they deployed some of our military personnel to Vietnam without the approval or prior knowledge of the general public or allowing for a referendum. They were definitely held to account for it.

New Zealand citizens have the right to full disclosure, it's stipulated in our Bill Of Rights Act 1990, so very few doors can be closed to us. Our right to access information is respected and protected by our laws.

There are many, many resources drawn from all manner of perspectives and sources that New Zealand citizens and people from overseas can use to determine the truth and how to identify when propaganda is being used to further a biased narrative. This video shouldn't have to be one of them.

`Are there any legitimate reasons to ban the viewing/downloading/spread of the material?`

Yes, because it implicitly violates the human and constitutional rights of the people shown in the video and it's a direct attack against their dignity as human beings. The video shows people suffering, and dying, and begging, and pleading for their lives. It portrays a white supremacist and a terrorist gunning down and murdering other human beings. He invaded their house of worship and shot people down when they were trying to flee. He tortured a woman by continually shooting her as she tried to run.

If ISIS can have their recordings of public executions censored/deleted on the grounds of inciting and encouraging terrorism, then why is this not being looked upon in the same manner? Isn't this also an act of terrorism by that logic? Didn't our government and our prime minister make it abundantly clear that this is undeniably and untenably an act of terrorism? How on earth can anyone try to defend this?

Hell, I am ashamed that I'm the same species as this being. To me, while I cannot deny he is another human being, he lost every ounce of his humanity once he chose to do this. He crossed his moral Rubicon long ago and I hope that he rots in that prison, because I know that he will be found guilty on the forty-nine counts of first degree murder. Better yet, I'd see him deported from my country to rot in an Australian prison because I don't want him here anymore, as I see it, he's not welcome here. Hell, send him to fucking Nauru for all I care, and Australia can welcome someone else more deserving of Australian citizenship in their country. 

The police are working at removing this video not because we're trying to impede on peoples' rights to view or distribute the material, that's not the point nor the objective. They're taking action on accordance to respecting the wishes of family members who do not want people seeing their family members subjected to extreme violence and unfathomable hatred and cruelty. This video is being taken down because family members specifically requested that it be taken down. That is not how anyone would ***ever*** want their family members remembered. They'd want their family members to be remembered with some sense of dignity afforded to them. They'd want their families to be respected, not revictimised. Respect for the dead has been observed by humanity since the dawn of time.

The objective here is that our government and our police force are acting in an effort to preserve and protect the fundamental rights of New Zealand residents and citizens, the people who are portrayed in this video, as is their primary objective. It is their fundamental duty to protect us, their citizens and their residents, and that is precisely their intent here. This video breaches and violates laws that protect us. The 'objectionable materials' are purposed and intended to protect victims of serious crimes, not as a means of silencing people. It's not the same as censoring a material because it is lewd, or vulgar, or otherwise socially inappropriate.

These people did not consent to have an evil bastard invading their house of worship and attacking them while they were acting benignly and peacefully. They did not consent to be filmed in a place and circumstance which afforded them a right to privacy. They did not consent to have their suffering broadcasted to thousands of people. They did not consent to have their dignity stomped on in every conceivable way. They don't deserve to have people mocking them and infringing on their dignity.

Hell, a lot of these people would be protected as subjects of political asylum/be legal refugees in New Zealand. These people probably fled from unimaginable conditions: genocide, poverty, famine, war, oppression, racial prejudices and all manner of hatred, and they fled to here. They came here because our country was their vigil of hope. They came here because they believed that we as a nation could protect them and shelter them and provide them a sense of safety that all human beings deserve. If these people immigrated here for other reasons, then they have a right to be here, because they were in accordance with our residency and citizenship laws and abided to all our laws. They had as much of a right to be here as I (a sixth generation New Zealander, possibly even further back on my maternal grandmother's side) do.

These people have *families*. These people have families who are devastated merely because this happened, they shouldn't be having to fight for their family members to be given a modicum of respect. They shouldn't have their rights questioned by anyone. It is their constitutional right as New Zealanders to be provided that respect. It is their constitutional rights as *human beings* to be treated with dignity and respect. I mean, Christ, even ***corpses*** have fundamental and constitutional rights. That's why it's illegal to take organs from a corpse when they didn't implicitly give their consent to be organ donors while they were still alive. Human rights extend to corpses as well and we shouldn't be ignoring that. The dead are protected under human rights laws, and this is indisputably a breach against those rights. We cannot deny that. We cannot.

So, that said, what is more important here? For the rights of someone outside of all this to be able to freely access and view this atrocity? Or is it the rights of the victims and their families to have their constitutional rights respected?

Is your freedom of speech more important than the wishes and dignity of the victims?

\-----------------

This all said and done, I absolutely support freedom of speech and I see it as a fundamental human right.

However, that said, I believe that there must be limitations placed on the propagation of freedom of speech for the good of everyone. I believe, and I'm sure that many other New Zealanders believe, freedom of speech ends where the right to use it is abused to attack and infringe on someone else's rights. Another way it could be put it is: if you are provided the right freedom of speech, it also means that you are held accountable for what you say and people have the right to condemn you for it. There has to be a goddamn line drawn in the sand here. This is a concept that I cannot fathom people don't seem to grasp. I don't understand how this can possibly be construed as an example of freedom of speech. The fact that people think their right to freedom of speech is more important than the fact that this video revictimises people and is a huge violation of their human rights is morally reprehensible. 

Also, if you guys can direct me to where I can explain the censorship laws on a wider scale or if you share this to relevant forums and subreddits, I'd be much obliged. It's not good, nor is it helpful, for these misconceptions to be furthered, especially given our current circumstances. We don't deserve to be on the receiving end of this much condemnation because we're trying to protect our citizens. We're not being Orwellian or draconian. We're not like SOPA. We're not trying to push an authoritarian agenda. We're trying to protect the victims in all this. We're trying to protect our people here. That's all we're trying to do. 

We literally couldn't care less about how any other nation chooses to define or exercise their rights to freedom of speech, that's their prerogative and their right. The only instance where we'll choose to intervene is when "freedom of speech" is directed maliciously to ***our protectees and citizens***. Because there is a difference between the two. Hate speech and freedom of speech are not synonymous to us and many other people. It is not something that should be protected, it should be condemned and isolated. 

White supremacy was once legal in many countries, remember that. Colonialism has damaged many countries, including New Zealand, and still has a very palpable effect on our people. While casual racism is still very much a thing in New Zealand (I was born in Auckland, one of the most culturally and ethnically diverse cities in the world and I've still seen many instances of racism growing up and I've been on the receiving end of it too), I know that most instances of racism here is born of ignorance and not hatred. There's a difference to what this man did (which was perpetrated on the basis of hatred) and someone being unaware or ignorant of the intricacies and customs of another culture or ethnicity. There's a difference between killing people based on race/culture/religion than yelling slurs at them or making ignorant and stupid comments to them. There is a difference to making threats/shit-talking/assholery and actually acting upon violence.  Ignorance is something that we can deal with: we can educate against it, promote culture in a non-appropriative manner (via cultural appreciation) and we can condemn those who attack other cultures. Hatred is something not as easily combatted against.

However, there has been a lot done to fight against racism, not just here in New Zealand, but across the world. In many Western countries, many white supremacists will never emerge from the holes from which they live in because they know it's condemnable. They know they're not free to express it. In New Zealand, if you're a victim of racism, you have the right to be afforded protection from it and for people to fight for you, not against you. You do not have to be a victim of racism, you are allowed to fight for yourself and expect people to fight with you. The world has made strides in progress fighting racism and persecution, and the objective of these materials was to go against everything we've tried to fight against. My grandmother has been a social and political activist for most of her life (she participated in the protests against the Vietnam War and the 1981 Springbok Tour, for example) and she said "the best and the worst of people emerged" in the wake of the Springbok Tour. The Springbok Tour awoke many New Zealanders to the racial and cultural issues being left to fester in our society and allowed us to begin discussing and trying to address them. While it's very clear to me that these issues are still present in our society, and dialogue on these issues must continue, I know that things could be much worse than they are, and I'm grateful that people can at least be afforded a chance to fight for themselves.

This terrorist's intent in spreading this video was to further his own narrative. He intended on triggering ideological rifts. He intended this as an act to turn people and countries against eachother. His intention wasn't to offer anything politically, socially or morally valuable to our societies, it was to promote and push for an agenda to silence and persecute others. For the love of God and all that is sanctified and respected, don't let him do that. Don't allow him that satisfaction. Don't allow anyone to follow and promote his agenda.

Let this fucker fade forever into the obscurity of the crueller side of history. 

Don't speak his name. 

Don't remember him. 

Remember the event and the people, and please give them the respect this asshole didn't give them.

>**EDIT:** Apologies ahead of time if my rhetoric offends anyone, I know I came off a bit strong in some of my points. As a New Zealander, I'm devastated by this mosque shooting. The last time we had a mass shooting with more than three fatalities was almost thirty years ago, this was completely unprecedented. The last racially-motivated massacre here was even longer ago than that.

>I'm just tired that people are continuing to spread misconceptions based on a lack of knowledge or on misunderstandings.

I wrote this post because I needed to shed light on the matter.

It's just that I feel that it doesn't bear much, if any, relevance in this case.

>EDIT 2: When I said you could read the manifesto if you wish, note that I am not actively encouraging you do so nor am I promoting its value as a material. While the material does outline its authors ideologies and motivations, you could debate its value. Half of it is memes and the other half is incomprehensible rambling, it doesn't offer much insight, if any. The material is still objectionable under the laws of my country and as a citizen, I must abide to and respect the laws of my country. I personally will not, nor will I ever participate in its distribution, if merely because I abhor the ideologies of its author and I refuse to play a part in promoting them. I have read the material, but this was because I accidentally encountered it ten minutes into its public release on Twitter (which was happening during the time of the shooting) and I didn't know what it was. As soon as I did, I reported it to the Department of Internal Affairs because I believed that it was objectionable and I deleted it off my phone. Do not ask me to provide you a copy or to tell you where you may find one, I will not aid anyone in either endeavour.

>EDIT 3: In regards to the fiasco surrounding Joshua Moon's response to our police force (because I may be asked about this), my initial thoughts are: while Joshua is well within his rights as a foreigner and a citizen of another country to not be compelled into complying to the requests of our police, the means of which he chose to respond were completely unnecessary and childish. He could've refused in a far more mature and polite manner, but instead he chose to be an edgelord. The fact that he did not censor the officer's name either is arguably an act of doxxing and it is quite despicable. Note that the officer said that it was pending a formal request (he approached Joshua out of courtesy to inform him that he was making a request and to ask if Joshua was willing to participate promptly due to the time it takes for the formal request to be fulfilled) and a government official of ours affiliated with the Five Eyes collective confirmed several days ago that the other members of the collective have agreed to participate in an international investigation. The U.S. are already working alongside us and agreed to help us, so it is highly unlikely that they'll decline any requests our police make of them regarding an inquiry into a terrorist attack. This said, it is very likely our police have initiated acquiring U.S. warrants and court orders through the appropriate diplomatic channels or they've submitted warrants to their governmental departments for endorsement. While Joshua will not be held accountable for his refusal, because it was well within his rights to refuse, he will absolutely be held accountable for the fact that he has encouraged the deletion of evidence when the police requested for its preservation. If he and his company are issued a subpoena, he will get into a shitload of trouble and he is fully deserving of it. I have zero sympathy for him and he is a fucking idiot.

As salaam alaikum. Kia kaha my friends. Peace with you all.
