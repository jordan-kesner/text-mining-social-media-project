Title: State of the Sub: Goodbye 2022!

Post:
Another year of politics comes to a close, and you know what that means…

### Holiday Hiatus

As we have done in the past, the Mod Team has opted to put the subreddit on pause for the holidays so everyone (Mods and users) can enjoy some time off and away from the grind of political discourse. We will do this by making the sub 'semi-private' from December 19th 2022 to January 1st 2023. You are all still welcome to join us on Discord during this time.

But the hiatus won’t be all fun and games for the Mod Team. We plan on using this time to mature our Moderation Standards, workshop some changes to the community, and best determine how we can continue to promote civil discourse in politics. We have a ton of feedback from our last Demographics Survey, but feel free to continue to make suggestions.

### High-Effort Discussion Posts

One area we would like to explore in 2023 is ways to encourage more high-effort discussion posts. While there is nothing wrong with the current lean towards news articles and Link Posts, we find that discussion-based Text Posts can often do a better job at promoting civil discourse. We once again welcome any suggestions that may further this goal. In the meantime, we may occasionally sticky a high-effort submission from the community to highlight the contribution.

### Clarification on Starter Comments

Earlier this year, we updated Law 2 with additional language to address what is and isn’t considered “substantive” in a starter comment. We did this hoping that it would promote higher-quality starters that better promote discussion. Unfortunately, it did just the opposite for some of our users. 

The Mod Team would like to remind all of you that the Law 2 requirements are *necessary* but not always “sufficient” to qualify a starter comment as “substantive”. As always, we ask that you put effort into your comments. Going forward, low-effort starter comments may be removed, even if they meet the previously-communicated requirements.

### Transparency Report

Since our last State of the Sub, Anti-Evil Operations have acted ~17 times. As in the past, the overwhelming majority were already removed by the Mod Team for Law 3 violations.

Top Comments:
A reminder to everyone: SotS is not the place for airing grievances with moderator actions. If you have questions about specific cases please take them to modmail or ask on the Discord.
Regarding the transparency report, was there anything taken down by AEO that would not have been taken down by the mods?
this isn't about any specific moderator action, and this place is one of the best subs on reddit, but its been very inconsistent for me, especially in regards to rule "1". There is also some confusion about whether rule 1 applies to just other redditors, or to public figures. It says "do not accuse fellow redditors of being intentionally misleading". So you can't call another redditor a "grifter"...but you can call a politician a grifter? What is the actual rule and who does it apply to?
Not a huge deal, but could we clarify what constitutes discussing a banned topic? I noticed on a recent post several comments about personal pronouns, including some made to me. They varied from mere FYIs to more substantive disagreements on the pronoun used. 

I felt like I was in a weird position with these later comments. The way I saw it, I couldn't get into the substantive issue per rule 5; I couldn’t acknowledge I couldn't discuss it per meta-rule. 

So I guess I'm wondering if it is in the mods' opinion best to ignore these types of comments, or there could be a narrow exception to say something along the lines of “per rule 5, I don't feel comfortable discussing these topics.”
I, as ever, question the existence of rule 4. It seems like the majority of the comments, since it’s inception, we’re simply aimed at “man this place is turning into r/politics or r/conservatives”. And I’m fine with that being a rule, though I think it more appropriately fits under rule zero with regard to Low effort comments. But I feel like it disrupts the broader conversations this sub should have about what it and it’s users are saying. And some of you were either going to tell me that this really isn’t a problem or that I should simply just make my own meta-post if I wanted to do that, but the ambiguity rule 4 presents I believe stifles expression needlessly and makes it harder for users to set the tone of the subreddit and discuss examples when they see them. 

If you need an example, one point that I often like to make is that I know there are some users who, certainly in the past, have been free-speech absolutist, and will tell me all about how this or that is trampling on everyone’s rights, but then will also praise how well moderated the sub is and what not. To me, the way that this sub runs should be, at least in part, an argument that demonstrates why absolute free speech is not really ideal and how certain expectations and standards preserve civility and facilitate functional discourse. And maybe some of you want to try and make the argument to me that you can be a free-speech absolutist and complain about the TOS of some other private company, but then be OK with the moderation on this particular subreddit, but I think that’s a pretty hard case to make. And I’m sure somebody is going to chime in here and tell me how that would be either acceptable or isn’t necessary to making a point, but why not? And why should it be so ambiguous? 

I should also be clear that I’m fine with mods making discretionary choices and having it be clear that that’s the case, but given that no one has ever really been able to actually define very well the purpose of rule for beyond the singular example that I’ve presented or that people can even agree with the term “meta“ means what real purpose does it serve? But I think effective and meaningful meta commentary can enhance and transform discourse, especially when done in conjunction with making a broader point on the actual issue at hand. So changing the wording and apparent scope of rule 4 may be something good.

Anyway, I know no one asked for my opinion, and I’m not sorry that I’ve basically barf it up here for everyone to consume, but I still want to promote this cause and maybe some of you agree or not. But let’s have a discussion about it.
>While there is nothing wrong with the current lean towards news articles and Link Posts

There needs to be a move away from news aggregators like yahoo (which should be straight ban) or reposts to msnbc like we saw last week. It is pretty important to understand where sources are coming from.
Any chance that   mocking the argument / comment, will be against the  Law 1. Civil Discourse. seems like there is a lot mocking peoples arguments instead of being nice.
Sometimes I just don't know.  WorksInIT posts a terrific article discussing progressives with loads of content and it's sitting at 0 upvotes, meanwhile a nonbinary person stealing luggage is up over 400.  What's there there to discuss in the second, except that theft is bad?  It was a long article, but it was well worth the read, but did we really have to throw it to the bottom?  

Same thing happens in comments.  You don't have to downvote a comment just because you don't like it, solid well reasoned comments shouldn't be hidden as I've been seeing more and more lately, they should be rebutted.
Thank you mods for allowing us to discuss politics without getting yelled at by either 'side' 
Hope yall have a happy Holliday season
