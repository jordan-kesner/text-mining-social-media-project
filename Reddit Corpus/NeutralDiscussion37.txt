Title: Why have revolutionary parties made no use of social media advertising to break the cultural hegemony and impose their narrative?

Post:

I'm thinking of how cheap social media advertising is. For example, $1 spent on a short video or an image on Facebook means reaching 1000 people. Why don't revolutionary parties make use of this to engage the population and to make their thoughts mainstream?

Here’s the big dirty secret:

Conservative messages aren’t popular.

Companies aren’t choosing liberal messages for the hell of it, they do it because it increases their overall profit margin.

Conservatives act as if the general public is unaware of their message while they spread it on a daily basis on the local level. There isn’t some wild coordination against you, people just don’t like you.
Too much exposure isn't always desirable for revolutionary parties.  They just become an easy target.  Better to create a safe space for discussion and grow from the grassroots word-of-mouth.
They're banned from the mainstream platforms. Besides that, as anyone who has tried FB and Google ads will tell you, reaching 1,000 people is almost useless. You need to reach hundreds of thousands, repeatedly, to get a few clicks, even with a highly targeted audience.
I mean, most revolutionary parties aren’t mainstream. It takes more than social media ads to make them mainstream. Also, I pretty sure they’ve been trying, the whole jan 6 ‘revolution’ was organised on social media. They’re still conspiracy butters even after all the Facebook posts
Social media can be good for organizing people politically, but generally for groups that already agree on things. The Arab Spring is a good example of social media facilitating discussion and organization.
