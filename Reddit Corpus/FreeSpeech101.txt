"Tech companies shouldn't censor information, its dangerous and we should strive for continued competition of social media".  Although true, the current President of Mexico has been sucking up to Trump, so its no surprise he has supported Trump in his false claims of election fraud. Another thing to understand is that the opposition party, PRI which previously had a party dictatorship in Mexico for decades, controls a lot of social media in Mexico.  So although we should push for more competition of social media, we should take what the president of Mexico says with a grain of salt.  The Mexican President is ignoring the fact that Trump is being censored for continued false claims of election fraud in order so he can stay in power and ignores the insurrection that occured.
