Title: State of the Subreddit Address: I Blame You

Post:
Consider me a visiting moderator for this address. I have been fairly inactive since Octoberish, but I have been lurking and very occasionally engaging in the sub. I have been inactive mostly because life is taking me in a different direction, and a very small part of my inactivity was due to frustration and confusion about how to handle the sub. But I have been tasked by the other mods to make this address. We mods do these addresses occasionally so that people can get an idea of how the subreddit looks to the moderators from a birds-eye view. It is typically titled “State of the Subreddit”, so if you search our history you can find more of these. I joined this subreddit after it had been established for 6 years, and for the following 4 years I had the pleasure of moderating disputes, clearing out the mod-queue, answering questions, “hiring” new moderators, and generally deciding the direction of the sub. IMO, the sub entered its golden age spiking from 14k users to about 40k users in that time. We picked up most of the moderators you now see, and lost a couple extremely good mods for various reasons. The conversations were generally reasoned, logical, moderately expressed - per the mission on our sidebar. Most of our moderation issues had to do with hunting down silly sock-puppets intent on trolling our sub, and explaining the difference between Rule 1 and 1b. Our diverse set of moderators were well equipped to differentiate between their political opinions and the fairly black and white ruleset of allowable content in the subreddit. I was always amazed at how well they were able to make bias free rulings.

...Then Donald Trump’s impeachment happened. We started to see a significant traffic flow increase in which our subreddit has tripled since then. People who did not understand the ethos, mission and culture of our sub started to overwhelm our small subreddit. Where typically our mods used to take the time to explain to new members how we are dedicated to the moderate expression of any political idea; they started having to judge the line between barely acceptable speech and immoderately expressed speech. The increased heat of our political era spawned a membership in our sub that was (and is) at odds with our mission. **To be clear, I am speaking to and about you.** Don’t look at the user you are currently conversing with. You. **You do not understand the mission of this subreddit**. Some of you are still saying… “Yes I do. It is everyone else that doesn’t”. No… you don’t. **I blame you**. Almost over-night, the members of this subreddit went from encouraging and protecting the moderately expressed dissenting opinion to beating everyone else’s obviously wrong opinion. While the mission of the subreddit had not changed, the culture and ethos of this subreddit did. Users became obsessed with winning arguments. Trump had to be beat by any means possible. Socialism had to be rejected by any means possible. My political view is the right view, and I will prove it to you.

Our mods were no longer equipped to handle this massive change in the subreddit. As I backed away, they started to implement rules that I had resisted and actively put down for 4 years. I am adamantly opposed to rule 0, the new text post rule, and the moderation pivot. And yet, I completely understand it. There is this natural phenomenon that when people push boundaries, the boundaries close. Kids discover this with their parents, teens discover this in their schools, citizens discover it in their governments, and you are discovering it in your subreddit. In an attempt to bring the subreddit back into line with its mission, our moderators have started to make rules which by default make them the arbiters of acceptable political opinion. If you do not line up with their political opinion you will be turned away. Why? Because you the user have conflated your moderately expressed opinion with your desire to win at all costs. As a result, this subreddit is not even close to the original tenet of free speech that it espoused 11 years ago. Please note, I am not blaming my fellow moderators. The amount of time and work they have put into this sub is commendable. Believe me, I know what it means to put emotion and effort into a community for no pay. I am blaming you. **The State of this Subreddit is failing** despite its massive spike in users. Where it once stood as the bastion of political free speech on reddit, out performing any other political subreddit across and within the spectrum of political ideologies; it now stands as a place where only limited political opinions are accepted. Again, don’t blame the Trump supporters, the socialists, or the Q-anon conspiracists, or the Russians or anyone else.

\---------------------------------------

So what can you do? How can you re-establish the subreddit back to its original ethos and culture? For some of you, you can leave. Yes, that sounds harsh, but if you are here to win then please just go away. This isn’t the subreddit for you. For some of you, you can let others be “wrong”. It is okay to walk away from a conversation saying, “Sorry brah, you’re wrong, and I have given the evidence for why. Have a nice day!” For some of you, you can simply accept that you are wrong. That’s okay too. Some of you can down-vote and not engage the ridiculous content that will inevitably show up in a political discussion forum. The thing that made and will make this subreddit great is when people tolerate an opposing political opinion. You don’t have to accept it. You don’t have to demean it. You don’t have to defeat it. Just tolerate it. Make your argument and move on. Give the opposing opinion that attacks content not character. Up-vote well argued opinions. Post great articles giving news or moderately expressed opinions. Express gratitude when conversing with someone who disagrees with you. Change the tone of your posts and comments to be one that stands “for” something instead of “against” “them”. **Stop looking for ways to express yourself that are barely within the rules**. Become the example for moderately expressed discourse to those around you by making the rules irrelevant.

You all know what needs to be done. You don’t need me to preach at you. You just need a kick in the pants to change the way you engage online. The person across from you is a human with a political opinion. Respect that person and engage as if they are a living breathing human. It is my hope that once the culture and ethos of this subreddit match the mission of the subreddit that our mods can start to loosen rules and allow the free exchange of ideas, both agreeable and disagreeable. Engage the opposing opinion the right way, and the sub can return to being the pinnacle of political discourse that it once was.

I miss when we were friends. 

As a mod of a less heated, but much larger sub, I make to you this recommendation:

Rewrite the rules. Make them very clear. Eliminate as much subjectivity in enforcement as you can. Then enforce them as close to the letter as possible. If a rule isn't working or is too subjective, you can change it any time.

Be careful in how you ask for feedback. You will find that people will often ask for things directly opposed to the best interests of the sub and you'll be forced to choose between giving the people what they want and keeping the sub from turning into a toxic cesspit of anger and sadness. As a mod, your duty is to the sub. The users will fight for and amongst themselves. The best you can do is ensure they do it elsewhere.

I am here because this is the only (I hate to say it) safe space where I can discuss some potentially unpopular political ideas. Sometimes it's not that I don't know the concept is wrong, it's that I want to discuss why it's wrong or how it's wrong. In other subs, that content couldn't even be up for discussion.
>The person across from you is a human with a political opinion

Not only this, the other person is also a human who may very well have likes and dislikes beyond politics that we identify with and may be a source of commonality. Even if those political views are a source of strong disagreement. Granted this format of interpersonal exchange can strip a lot of ourselves away from what others see, but that does not make us caricatures of ourselves.

> We started to see a significant traffic flow increase in which our subreddit has tripled since then. People who did not understand the ethos, mission and culture of our sub started to overwhelm our small subreddit.

It's worth noting that this dynamic closely parallels the "[Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September)," referring to the influx of AOL users to Usenet groups starting in 1993. 

Online communities are social groups like any other, with norms and expectations that new members learn by observation in order to be accepted by the group. But when the influx of new users is larger than the existing group, the norms and expectations get lost in the noise and are no longer distinguishable as the baseline.

Trying to maintain something of that golden age of the subreddit in the face of this ongoing phenomenon has been the shared goal and the challenge we're all trying to solve for.
If I could offer some tips that may or may not help out with dialogue:

**Find Common Ground**

People are less likely to listen to someone hostile or indifferent to their own position. Take time to find something that you agree on or have in common.

**Understand the conversation**

Take time to ask questions to clarify a person's position. People, especially in stressful situations, don't communicate clearly. They can create grandiose expressions that aren't exact to a more nuanced view.

**Clarify Definitions**

People may have slightly different definitions to your own. Racism, Anti-Gun, Free Speech are commonly used in this form. It's helpful to understand what they mean to have a productive conversation.

**Question**

Instead of putting your objections in a form that is 'I believe... " Try wiring in a format where you don't use the words "I" or "You" (or be mindful of the context when using them -- are the creating alienation?). Trying using something similar to the [Socratic Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) when questing theirs believes. Understand that this will not change their framework but may provide you or them with some additional information.

**End the Conversation**

If you get frustrated, feel the conversation turn into an argument, find the correct time to leave. Say goodbye, thank you for chatting, and move on with your life. Understand they may also feel the same way. It happens, and it's better to end a conversation than to invest too much of yourself and feel frustrated.

**You Cannot Win**

Even if you strongly believed the other person is wrong, understand a conversation will rarely change their position. Most people hold a position with many different views all at once so even when you start to question one other can come in to hold the view up again. At most, you can only get them to be more critical of their beliefs. Be calm and patient and understand no one will ever win or lose.

for a trip down memory lane.  from 7 months ago, although it basically feels like an eternity.

interesting to see how people's thoughts about it have changed in the intervening time.
Sometimes I feel like that reddit rule that no one follows: "Upvote comments that add to the discussion, not ones you agree with" has the potential to make reddit a lot better.
Back after a 7 day ban for rule
0. Hey everyone.

Since we're talking about the new enforcement of rules I thought this'd be a good place to discuss my first hand experience with it briefly. Regardless of whether my ban was justified (I am erring on the side that it was, although I disagree since them's the way these things go) I was unable to get ahold of a mod through PMs to question my ban. It is plausible that my personal history may have something to do with it (I've been warned in the past for a meta comment) but the lack of any replies like I've been able to get in the past suggests the mods are either treating ban appeals differently or they're immensely overworked to the point that they can't reply to subreddit members. The latter suggestion sounds like OP's observation.

One thing I noted during my absence is that most of the new threads don't seem to have any actual discussion in them. This is for pro-conservative and pro-liberal leaning pieces. The vast majority of starter comments aren't questions, they're observations on the article and everyone else is agreeing or disagreeing with them. You could replace each topic with a poll "agree y/n?" and get a similar level of discourse. The most discussion I've seen are on the comparisons between BLM riots and the storming of the Capitol. But comments are so heated that they're not trying to open dialogue, instead it's a trial by jury where the either party tries to one-up the other and the most popular opinion is decided by upvotes. You can't have an opinion anymore, you have to be right or wrong. 

I am curious about what u/RECIPR0C1TY means when they talks about "free speech." Are they talking about saying what you want without moderation?  Because r/politics and r/political discussion are both subreddits where the ability or insult or degrade your opponents unchallenged has led to a toxic and circular dialogue.
This is just my experience, but...

Conversations about things like states’ rights, gun rights, theoretical or moral issues go off mostly without a hitch. It’s just current events that devolve into chaos, and it’s because there’s no shared truth.
There's an easy fix: just nuke comments mercilessly. Don't blame us, it's your fault for not enforcing your rules and boundaries. Don't ask people to leave, make them want to leave.

I like to think of myself as a pretty average redditor, and while I might read the explicit rules when I first join a sub, that's probably the only time I'll read them. Everything else I know about the sub is informed by how others behave within it. If you are tolerating certain comments and attitudes, it doesn't matter what your rules say. I can see which comments get upvoted, which get downvoted, and what kind of content is "moderate enough" to not be deleted.

Someone who is invested in their comments is going to think twice if their last 2 essays were deleted for breaking rules. Someone who gets away with writing whatever they want, won't. If I don't need to make my comments as unimpeachable as possible, I won't. It's great that your users used to be more mindful on their own, but it's not really relevant; every organization gets more complex as it grows.
