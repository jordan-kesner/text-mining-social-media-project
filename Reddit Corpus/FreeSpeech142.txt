Title: Didn't Penn Gillette host a libertarian debate in Vegas today? Does anyone know how it went? Where/when will I be able to see it online?

Penn said on his most recent podcast that he has permission to post the full debate on the podcast. So at least an audio version will be coming soon. 
I'm looking for it, but can't find it. I was about to ask the same question when I saw your post.
A well-organised LP with charismatic leadership and a strong PR game will only serve to more-effectively split the anti-Hillary small-govt vote, allowing Her Crookedness to sail into the Oval Office without much of a fight.

Which is why all the smart libertarians stay far away from the Party, leaving it in the decrepit state it is in.
Oh look, someone who wants us to believe you're wasting your vote by not voting D or R. How boring.

I actually do think there's something to the idea that a Trump presidency would remind Congress that they can actually say no to the president, but that's nowhere near a good enough reason to vote for him.
