"hate speech" -- i.e. wrongthink

Of course they didn't tell us even generally what was said, much less what exactly was said, so we only have their word.

Was it Muhammad cartoons?  

No, the hate speeches and fake news are actually made by Islamists (or opportunist)  against current government and minority group.
Spreading fake news about how the government is anti-Islam, communist, and controlled by China is not reporting government abuse. You clearly have no idea.
