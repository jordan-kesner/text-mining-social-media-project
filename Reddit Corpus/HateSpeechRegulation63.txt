It's too early to say Threads is already dying. It's been what? A week? Two weeks? It takes time to build audiences and a strong, regular following. The fact that they got 100M signups in that time is incredible.

Give it time. There will be ups and downs but I think Threads can pull through.
OP here!

I handcurate these updates every week. I work full-time as a marketer. Only trying to help the community.

In case, you like this you can join my newsletter: The Social Juice (link in my bio). I send sources & researches to in that!

‚Ä¢	‚Å†I send orange juice made from oranges at my tiny garden to random subscribers. üçä
I‚Äôm only 15 minutes in to having a Threads account, and yikes, it is utter garbage. It doesn‚Äôt even have the most basic of basics, such as‚Ä¶a feed that shows you Threads from people you actually follow‚Ä¶instead of a feed of random trash. I‚Äôm literally stunned at how terrible of a platform it is. They released this‚Ä¶by choice?!
The sign up numbers were due to users logging in to instagram and being pushed to sign into threads. I, like many others did this and took a look. I looked, didn't like it, and will never log in again.
