*(Note: These are the updates from the last 48-72 hours.)*

MARCH 30 - 

*General:*

* Coronavirus death rate is lower than previously reported, study says, but it's still deadlier than seasonal flu. The research, published in the medical journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, estimated that about 0.66% of those infected with the virus will die. That coronavirus death rate, which is lower than earlier estimates, takes into account potentially milder cases that often go undiagnosed -- but it's still far higher than the 0.1% of people who are killed by the flu. When undetected infections aren't taken into account, the Lancet study found that the coronavirus death rate was 1.38%, which is more consistent with earlier reports.

*Updates from around the world:*

* Portugal has temporarily given all migrants and asylum seekers full citizenship rights, granting them full access to the country's healthcare as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus escalates in the country.

But the president and his team have shifted their message radically in recent days, as virus cases have begun surging, urging people to stay home and to practice social distancing — and warning of dire results if that advice is ignored.

What do you guys think about the new formatting I used for March 26 vs what I've used previously (see March 25 and 24)? Is it helpful to have them separated by world and US like that? Or do you prefer just a straight list?
Construction Superintendent here, currently working in Suburban Chicago.   

We are full speed ahead.  Nearly all projects in the area have been deemed essential.   I have new Covid-19 protocols, but it's virtually impossible for me to enforce 6' social distancing.  I had a concrete pour yesterday, it was a small one but still, there were 4 or 5 guys working on top of each other.  I notified the crew of their violation, but as soon as I walked away, they were back at it. 

I'm certain that construction is going to continue until people start getting sick en masse on the jobsites. 

And as for myself, on one hand I am glad to be working but on the other, I am scared about what it's going to cost us.
