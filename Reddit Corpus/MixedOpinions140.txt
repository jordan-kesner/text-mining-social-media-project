Title: CMV: Alcohol is substantially more dangerous than marijuana.

Post:

I’m a registered nurse. I spent my first 10 years in trauma hospital watching the ravages of alcohol. G.I. bleeds, liver failure, pancreatitis, alcohol poisoning, drunk driving (cars,  boats, motorcycle, jet skiis) domestic violence from alcohol, bar fights from alcohol… Not to mention the other long-term risks of heart disease,cancer, liver failure, GI bleeds, Warnicke’s encephalopathy… Suicides were also often drunk.

“The CDC reports that nearly 88,000 alcohol-related overdose deaths occur each year. “

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE/CRIME

Substance abuse is commonly associated with domestic violence, assaults, and crime. Marijuana reduces that risk rather than increasing the risk of IPV.

“A study on marijuana use and intimate partner violence found that couples who used marijuana had lower rates of intimate partner violence in the first 9 years of marriage. “

ACCIDENTS:

“Besides alcohol, marijuana is the most commonly detected drug in drivers involved in car accidents. One study found that marijuana increased the odds of being in car accident by 83%. You may think that 83% is high, but when alcohol was involved, the odds of being in a car accident increased more than 2,200%!”

CANCER:

Even moderate use of alcohol has been shown to increase risk for cancers including: Mouth, Esophageal, stomach, Colon, breast, bladder, pancreas.

“ Even one drink a day increases the risk of developing cancers of the female breast, mouth, and esophagus.”

OTHER HEALTH EFFECTS:

Pancreatitis, Mallory Weiss tears, esophageal varices, Warnicke Korsakoff syndrome, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, alcoholic cardiomyopathy liver failure…

CARDIAC:

Both cause vasoconstriction with deleterious cardiac effects. The link between alcohol and heart disease is more firmly established. Including the risk for cardiomyopathy. I think it remains to be seen the effects of marijuana on cardiovascular health long-term.

“Excessive alcohol intake can lead to high blood pressure, heart failure or stroke. Excessive drinking can also contribute to cardiomyopathy”

THE BRAIN:

Use an adolescent seems to cause some possible long-term brain effects. But use an adult alcohol causes structural changes and issues in the brain that marijuana does not.

“Their findings linked alcohol consumption with long-term changes to the structure of white matter and gray matter in the brain. The use of marijuana, however, seemed to have no significant long-term effects on brain structure”

This is not accurate for the adolescent brain. Adolescent should not be using marijuana:

“Some studies suggest regular marijuana use in adolescence is associated with altered connectivity and reduced volume of specific brain regions involved in a broad range of executive functions such as memory, learning, and impulse control compared to people who do not use.”


In conclusion: oral ingestion of marijuana  (smoking does have some increased risks to the lungs and esophagus) is far superior drinking in terms of safety.

I remember one time a medical examiner mentioned that marijuana was definitely a gateway drug because lots the people who ended up dying from heroin ODs started with marijuana and progressed to harder drugs. But her perspective was highly warped since she only dealt with the marijuana users who progressed to the hardest drugs and didn’t deal with weed smokers who either stopped doing it or never did anything more intense. She saw the worst cases and generalized from her perspective. I think something similar is happening with you. As a trauma nurse, you’re probably exposed to the worst aspects of alcohol abuse and it can be very easy to generalize.

I agree that alcohol is worse than marijuana though. But we already tried doomerist style approaches with DARE and it flopped so bad that now it’s mostly used as the butt of a joke.
Currently I would say you are correct, but it isn’t really a fair comparison because alcohol is well studied in mass and weed isn’t. You are essentially comparing one of the most widely used and well studied drugs to one that is illegal in a lot of places and no where near as well researched. The mental effects of weed could be way worst than what the limited research suggests.  It is not like we have 100s of years worth of data on nation wide weed consumption like we do with alcohol. So while you can say weed is better based on the research, I don’t think you can say that it is better definitively.
We just outright don't have enough data on marijuana to make any real claims.

It's still illegal at the federal level, the earliest recreational legalization was barely a decade ago, and with the vast variety of delivery methods we can't possibly make any certifiable claims at this time.

The data you have on alcohol is correct, but alcohol is legal and has been legal in a federal capacity since 1933. Hell even at the state level it's been legal in every state since 1966. 

Until we get a full lift on marijuana prohibition then all we are going to get is either volunteers which is going to dramatically skew any statistics even something as personal as witnessing things first hand in a hospital.
I think you need to add the proviso that alcohol is more dangerous to adults.   Kids rarely accidentally ingest alcohol (because it's generally not packaged as candy, cookies or brownies) and if the acute risks to kids are low (because hard liquor tastes terrible, as far as kids are concerned).

While alcohol poisoning is common, it's not for kids. But thc-based edibles are sending kids to the hospital at alarming rates.  Toddlers seem *particularly* sensitive and have much more severe overdose symptoms than adults (I've overdosed on THC as an adult and it's mostly pretty awesome) In the past decade, there have been more than 20 incidents where young kids have needed **ventilation** as a result ingesting THC edibles. These kids literally could not breathe on their own and needed a machine to breathe for them.  Without medical intervention, those would have been dead kids . . .  But how often does a child under 10 ingest enough alcohol to be seriously harmed long-term?
I could not agree with you more and for no other reason that seeing so many people absolutely ruined permanently by alcohol addiction.  When I meet someone that stopped drinking and has not relapsed it almost seems superhuman.

I would not wish that fate on my worst enemy, it is life ruining, I can't think of another substance I would call as bad.
Okay, but let's think about the numbers on this. How easy is it to breathalyze someone or detect that they're drunk after an accident? How easy is it to do with someone who has been smoking marijuana? Right off the bat, our numbers are skewed by the ease of getting data. Plus, isn't something harder to detect/punish people for inherently more dangerous? If I can get away with driving drunk three times, and driving high 200 times, how much safer does driving high have to be before it's actually a bigger danger to society?

Ditto the lack of studies. Alcohol use has been studied since the temperance movement. Pot hasn't. In fact, when trying to find data on stuff like marijuana use and beating your kid, even the people studying it acknowledge a lack of research. Though, there well could be a connection. Maybe people were just obsessed with the "drink dad who beats his kid" thing and didn't study pot enough. 

*Our literature review revealed a lack of research related to marijuana and parenting. One cross-sectional study found no relationship between marijuana use and neglect, but a positive association between marijuana use and frequency of child physical abuse*

Ditto stuff like cancer. If we assume people born in the 1930's are dying of cancer now (since cancer kills the old), what percentage drank a ton in their youth and what percentage smoked a ton in their youth? How sure are we it's not a preference thing? 

What about the gateway drug stuff? Yes, there are mice and rat studies showing that marijuana can change the neural pathways in users that increases the odds of you becoming an opioid addict. Throw in the opiod addicts who wouldn't have become ones without youth marijuana use and those numbers are gonna change drastically. But without really studying the life and brain of some 25 year old who OD's, we don't put that down as having a marijuana connection.

Anxiety disorders, psychosis, there's lots of connections to marijuana there. But statistically those suicides wouldn't go down as marijuana related, right? You'd have to really study the person to trace their disorder's beginning. Doesn't mean marijuana didn't cause it. Remember the "human zombie ate the man's face on bath salts" story? He wasn't on bath salts at all. Just marijuana. 

Also, remember that alcohol has been perfected over centuries. Big business has just gotten its hands on marijuana. It's tough to get fat eating a stalk of cane sugar, but it's easy to get fat drinking soda. Old marijuana was the stalk of sugar, the new stuff they're putting out (and are gonna put out) is the Twinkies. 

Overall, it may well be that alcohol is just easier to detect, studied more, and that alcoholics stop at alcohol while marijuana leads to other issues that are harder to trace back to it.
