It doesn't seem wrong that there are some platforms where people don't have compete with... lets face... porn or porn-adjacent content.
There was a girl who was clothed that was drawing a realistic nude of herself. Was a clever way to abuse the rules. 

Figured they would crack down a bit
It was only yesterday that I commented that Twitch will push this right up to the point that their advertisers balked. I guess that happened sooner than expected.
Let’s be real here with as many advertisers they have on the platform there was no way in Nike that this was ever going to last. They would’ve lost so much money from ad revenue and not to mention, it would only be a matter of time before someone underage claiming to be 18+ was caught doing a body painting stream and boy oh boy can you imagine how much trouble Twitch would’ve been in for that.
Honestly, it'd probably cause more problems than good--especially considering how one defines "artistic nudity." In addition to enforcing parental oversight, re-addressing the plethora of double standards they have, and waving through an ocean of liability, their decision is pretty reasonable. An uncommon occurrence on Twitch.
Didn't really like how twitch thots started farming lil kids to pump their view count so they can push their onlyfans and make some money at the same time
