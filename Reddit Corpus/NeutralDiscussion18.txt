I have a keyboard and a guitar. There's plenty of songs out there, plenty new variations to learn and teach myself :-) I can spend hours on my instruments.
If you have pets, play with your pets. Cleaning while listening to music can be fun, too. I've been making a lot of magnets lately + rollerskating indoors.
