Trump has become increasingly threatening lately with claims of "enemies within" threatening to weaponize the DOJ and even using the national guard and military to get even and calling for special military tribunals. If he wins, is he likely to implement these plans or is he saying all this in jest?

Some of those who have worked closely with him in the past and others who have faced the wrath of Trump believe he is quite capable of following through with his threats. Others, like Johnson \[Speaker of the House\] have dismissed his comments as jest and comical or otherwise tried to rationalize it.

He has often threatened what he has described as democrats and leftists, but also named Nancy Pelosi and Adma Schiff specifically \[among others\].

On [Fox News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmmx1zQCQds&t=485s), Trump expressed support for using government force against domestic political rivals. Since 2022, when he began preparing for the presidential campaign, Trump has issued more than 100 threats to investigate, prosecute, imprison or otherwise punish his perceived opponents, NPR has found.

A review of Trump’s rally speeches, press conferences, interviews and social media posts shows that the former president has repeatedly indicated that he would use federal law enforcement as part of a campaign to exact “[retribution](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/109967829299924979).”

Vice President Kamala Harris “should be impeached and prosecuted,” Trump [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgdVgxxELbQ&t=1590s) at a rally last month.

“I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” Trump [said](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/bFORNS0mvNOxmr9cbwwpUJRzq-pofVnRhYN3vHJKQdeiFjefDAKwDpPowHng3r_kHNX-RDMkd2KrzETglXlCPsGi_Wk?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1706.4) last year.

Journalists who decline to identify the sources of leaked information would also face imprisonment, Trump said.

When right-wing radio host Glenn Beck asked Trump if he would lock up his opponents in a second term, Trump [responded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lywHT5uH71M&t=124s), “The answer is you have no choice because they’re doing it to us.”

Legal experts said that there are few guardrails preventing Trump from pursuing his plans to prosecute opponents and noted that Trump pressured the Department of Justice to investigate rivals during his first term. In about a dozen cases, the Justice Department followed through and initiated investigations, according to one [analysis](https://www.justsecurity.org/98703/chronology-trump-justice-department/).

If he wins, is he likely to implement these plans or is he saying all this in jest?

> Less than a year later, Mr Trump gave an interview with Playboy magazine that was positioned as a tease of a future in politics. He said wasn't impressed with the Soviet Union or former President Mikhail Gorbachev, who lost control of Russia because he didn't have a "firm enough hand".

> When asked by Playboy writer Glenn Plaskin if he meant a "firm hand as in China", Mr Trump said the Chinese government almost blew it when students poured into Tiananmen Square.

> "**Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength**," he said.

> "**That shows you the power of strength**. Our country is right now perceived as weak... as being spit on by the rest of the world."

> In the same interview, **Mr Trump predicted that Russia's president would be overthrown for showing extraordinary weakness** that would lead to a violent revolution and destroy the Soviet Union.

Fast forward. It's 2020, the BLM protests are out in force and opportunistic rioters take advantage of the chaos.

[What was Trump's reaction?](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/09/1097517470/trump-esper-book-defense-secretary)

> "The president was enraged," Esper recalled. "He thought that the protests made the country **look weak**, made **us look weak and 'us' meant him. And he wanted to do something about it.**

> "We reached that point in the conversation where he looked frankly at [Joint Chiefs of Staff] Gen. [Mark] Milley and said, '**Can't you just shoot them, just shoot them in the legs or something?**' ... It was a suggestion and a formal question. And we were just all taken aback at that moment as this issue just hung very heavily in the air."

Esper was eventually fired. [Why?](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/politics/esper-insurrection-act-protests/index.html)

>  Secretary of Defense Mark Esper is on shaky ground with the White House after saying Wednesday that he does not support using active duty troops to quell the large-scale protests across the United States triggered by the death of George Floyd and those forces should only be used in a law enforcement role as a last resort.

> Speaking from the Pentagon briefing room podium, Esper noted that “we are not in one of those situations now,” distancing himself from President Donald Trump’s recent threat to deploy the military to enforce order. 

Who does the "enemy within" *actually* threaten? Trump's image. They take away from his popularity, they cast him in a bad light. They make him look **weak.** And history shows exactly how he intends to deal with that.
Best example of politicians letting Trump be horrendous is Susan Collins stating Trump wouldn’t retaliate after the impeachment, boy was she wrong and she was silent.
It's pretty hard to view it as anything other than serious when he keeps repeating it and expanding on how he's going to attack his list of detractors, and also keeps specifying more people that are on said list. 


If it was supposed to be a joke it presumably would have ended once everyone found it concerning instead of humorous.
Trump doesn’t get humor like a normal person, he says nothing in jest. He means every word, anyone that believes Trump joking about what he’s saying is coping.
The enemy within is literally Nazi propaganda. Calling your opponents evil or vermin is Nazi propaganda. I know the abjectly stupid human who is Donald J Trump likes alliteration when slinging his ad hominems, but he could have chosen a better word than Shifty for Adam Schiff--a Jew whose family fled the Holocaust... an event that occurred because Nazi propaganda painted all Jews as shifty. When Trump says immigrants are poisoning our blood, he's using Nazi propaganda. When he tells his white crowds about how he thinks they have good genes, he's using Nazi propaganda.

None of these ideas are new. Donald J Trump isn't even the first to use these terms and concepts in the USA, seeing as the Klan and Nazi party have been saying the same for decades. If Donald J Trump doesn't think these things, he sure knows that part of his base is very familiar with all of them.
I read this article recently which does an analysis of why people don't think Trump is really that bad and why it would be different in a second Trump term.

Basically, Trump's worse impulses were actively frustrated by his team during his first term. But he's spent quite a bit of time surrounding himself with yes-men this time around, and the establishment types aren't going to be in charge. He'll absolutely do everything he says, as much as it is possible for him to do.
You’d be an idiot to assume “but he won’t really do that.” At this point, the burden is on his cultists to prove he won’t, not on you, a person with functioning ears, to prove he’ll do the thing he said he’ll do multiple times now.

It’ll start with high profile Democrats, but it won’t stop there. Look at Stalin’s USSR, Hitler’s Germany, and every other nightmare shit hole throughout history. As someone who’s been a low level part time official employee of past Democratic candidate campaigns, I’m preparing contingency plans.
He definitely means it! He asked while he was president if the national guard could shoot the peaceful protesters. He's a facsist that wants to be a dictator. His ex-wife Ivana said that he used to keep the Book of Hitlers speaches on his nightstand. That's where he modeled his racism, homophobia, propoganda and hate from. And  Nazism was modeled after Jim Crowe.
Oh. He means it. All the media can talk about is Arnold Palmer’s penis.

Trump is as shrewd as he is lewd. 

Protesters? Jail. Immigrant? Jail. False evidence, blacklisting, the entire McCarthy playbook out of the gate.

How far does it go? I don’t think the entire Nazi playbook or civil war are off the table.

For those that don’t know, our civil war was the most horrifying moment in our history.
Trump will do everything that wants and is available to him. He’s built up quite a grudge these last four years and is going to be attacking anyone whoever made him feel small or foolish. And he’s a child. He has no ability for even strategic restraint if something is truly upsetting him. 

He said he’ll be a dictator on day one, and the thing about dictators is they never give up power. If people around him let him do what he wants, it will happen. 

A lot of people are dependent on Trump winning for their own legal safety and they’ll do nothing to stand in his way. 

They are really looking forward to watching the world burn.
