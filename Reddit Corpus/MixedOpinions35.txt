Title: CMV: Trump's social media ban is totally justified

Post:
I see a lot of people clutching their pearls and bemoaning Trump's ban from social media as unjust, Orwellian, and anti-free speech. It even drew some ire from Edward Snowden. I'm aware Twitter has banned other accounts in the wake of the 6th, but for sake of argument let's just focus on Trump and his Twitter in particular. I think it was fair to ban him. He fanned the flames before and after the election leading up to the 6th and prior to his suspension, there was no indication he was repentant. At the beginning of 2020, his calls to liberate various states lead to their capitals getting stormed in some cases, and a plot kidnap the governor of Michigan (which he never apologized for). There are still plenty of extremists of all stripes with ideologies that are vile/anti-gov/anti-Twitter/violent that are still posting on Twitter in the wake of the ban, but that's because they didn't incite real life violence, not because Twitter is rife with partisan censorship. The US doesn't have free speech absolutism to begin with, no matter how you slice it. We have laws against incitement because we've agreed as a society that incitement is wrong, so I think calling this "a violation of his free speech" or something like that is a bad faith argument. Another argument I've seen is that this sets the precedent for more bans and censorship that people without power won't be able to contest, and that this is a slippery slope. I also think this is a bad faith argument. Doesn't matter if the president or Joe Schmoe says "I'm inciting you to start a riot", it's still wrong. 

TLDR: Trump fucked around and found out IMO. Change my mind.

I don't necessarily disagree with you. I think that if Trump violated Twitter's terms and services, Twitter has the right to ban him (I'm not sure if he did because I've never read Twitter's terms and services,  but I'll take your word for it).


I guess there are only two questions I have for you:


1) In your mind, does "inciting real life violence" only apply to domestic issues in your mind? If the next president were to say on Twitter, "I'm going to continue drone strikes in the Middle East" or "Let's all invade Iran" would that be a good enough reason to remove a politician according to your view? How is a declaration of war any different from inciting violence?


2) If the president is saying some awful shit, don't you want to know about it? If Trump posts something on Twitter, everyone with a Twitter account gets to see what he said. On an app like Parler where the president could post, all of us non-Parler users wouldn't know what he was saying until the news reported on it. While I condemn violence and inciting violence of any kind, I'd like to know when it's happening and who's doing it so that I know when I should be concerned.
Why hasn't Twitter banned the leader of Iran then, who has made *multiple* threats against the United States as a country, and on the life of the President of the United States? Why hasn't Twitter banned Rose City Antifa, a twitter account that used Twitter to organize left-wing riots in Portland, among other places?

> and a plot kidnap the governor of Michigan (which he never apologized for)

Are you *seriously* blaming Trump for that? The people responsible were anarchist kooks that hated Trump just as much as they hated Whitmer.

But the simple fact of the matter is that the courts have already ruled that Trump's Twitter account is a public square and Trump legally cannot ban anyone from it. Therefore, because it is a public square, Twitter cannot ban Trump from it without infringing upon *his* First Amendment rights.

If you expect Trump to *apologize* for the plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan, then Biden and Harris should be personally apologizing for the 2017 attempted assassination of a sitting Republican Congressman, and for the cold blood execution of a Trump supporter in broad daylight by a left-wing terrorist (who was later killed in a confrontation with police) last year.
I worry about the precedent it sets though. Maybe it was justified in this case, but the idea that the CEO of a private company can decide that the democratically elected leader of a state isn't allowed to get their message across over their software - in the context of a world in which 4 CEOS own almost all the world's software for getting messages out - is a major institutional risk to the functioning of society. It basically means if those 4 CEOS don't like you then even if you win an election you have no voice, and since the primary role of the President is to be a voice that means that in effect those 4 CEOs have veto power over the President. And we didn't elect any of them.
" The US doesn't have free speech absolutism to begin with, no matter how you slice it. We have laws against incitement because we've agreed as a society that incitement is wrong, so I think calling this "a violation of his free speech" or something like that is a bad faith argument. "

Our laws against incitement are *extremely narrow*, though. They only cover speech that is *imminently likely* to *actually cause* lawless action. Shouting "Let's kill all the Jews" is perfectly legal. Shouting "We should kill all the Jews" in front of a crowd of anti-Semites is perfectly legal. The limits of free speech in the US is shouting "Let's kill all the Jews ... and there's one right there!!" and pointing to a guy in front of a crowd of anti-Semites. **That's** what "incitement" is in American jurisprudence.

Do you think that Trump's tweets come anywhere near that?
Is it not concerning that a **sitting** president gets censored off every single mass communication website in one day?

Also his speech is absolutely covered by free speech. He did not encourage violence or killings, only the act of protest.

Twitter is a public square also (by a court's ruling). There's also Marsh vs Alabama in company towns and free speech.
If a politically homogenous group of unelected Techno-Oligarchs, flexing their power by deplatforming and censoring the democratically elected representative of the most powerful nation in the world, from what essentially has become the modern public square, doesn't concern you maybe you should read some Cyperpunk for inspiration. The power they hold over our democracies, by being able to control the narrative is intense.

If you think Twitter's censorship isn't politically biased you are either arguing in bad faith or ignorant. Just look at their ruling on dead naming. They don't give a fuck that the policy they enforce goes against half of the countries' view on those issues, they think they are moral arbiters. The same could be seen from lefties supporting BLM riots and violence, they just don't face the same consequences. Legacy and establishment media have been legitimising political violence for years, without much pushback from these corporations.

Those against censorship seldom belief that these things warrant a ban from anything is the obvious point.

> We have laws against incitement because we've agreed as a society that incitement is wrong

There may be laws against incitement, but these laws are as laws tend to be unevenly enforced.

In practice they are enforced far more strictly when it's enciting violence towards a cause the censor opposes, and far more laxly when it's towards a cause the censor agrees with.

> so I think calling this "a violation of his free speech" or something like that is a bad faith argument. 

I then again don't call it that; I simply say "It should not have happened and it's politically motivated that it did.".

> TLDR: Trump fucked around and found out IMO. Change my mind.

Many fucked around that didn't get banned, but if you fuck around in a way that Twitter likes or towards a cause they approve of then you won't get banned—it's that simple
Laws against incitement to violence only apply to direct incitement to violence with intent.  This idea that claiming an election was fraudulent amounts to incitement to violence is not based in any legal reality.  

The legal standard is :  

>	Advocacy of force or criminal activity does not receive First Amendment protections if (1) the advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action, and (2) is likely to incite or produce such action.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imminent_lawless_action

If you want to argue that it was likely to produce such an action - then you, with your 20/20 hindsight, assume you know better than the federal intelligence agencies whose recommendations led to failure to prepare adequately for the events of Jan 6, 2021.  

In addition the federal law stipulates:  

>	Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including, but not limited to, the mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television, with ***intent***--

>	(1)  to incite a riot;  ... 

https://codes.findlaw.com/us/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/18-usc-sect-2101.html

The key here is intent.  Pretty clearly based on the reactions to the violence by Republican law makers, including the President - violence was not the *intent* and to my knowledge Trump has condemned violence where it has erupted at every turn.  

The issue in my mind is that social media companies have far too much power.  Trump is still the sitting president of the United States of America (for better or worse) and these social media companies function as the new digital public square and as such warrant new special regulation.  

It is unconscionable, in my opinion, that a social media company can allow a storm of negative accusations without evidence that are now provably false (Russia-gate) - which clearly amounted to an attempt to undermine the results of the 2016 election by the left.  In 2020 - they suddenly change their policies s.t. questioning the results of a historical election breaks their ToS?  Complete insanity.  We all know that if the shoe were on the other foot this would not have happened.  

Want to talk about *election interference* - how is the *overt suppression* of negative news stories concerning the Biden family pre-2020 not a form of election interference?  How can we have suppression of (thus far) undisputed accusations (supported by evidence) on one side - while allowing crazy conspiracy theories that Trump is an agent of Russia to flourish?  

My point here is that social media companies are claiming for themselves a position of arbiters of truth - a position to which they have no right.  While this is currently *legal* under their Section 230 protection - this protection *ought* be revoked for the sake of freedom of thought and discourse in our society.
 Saying "their right to do whatever, free business": That's not a valid excuse when these sites have a monopoly on public discussion and social discourse. Therefore, since these sites have made it so they are incredibly valuable and important in modern social and political discourse, banning people because they do not align with your current views IS censorship. Also, the literal definition is:

the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.

Also, these companies have a monopoly of public discourse:

Whilst I don't think it's morally wrong, it is nonsensical. There are literal world dictators on Twitter that Twitter has no interest in banning. The only reason they banned him when he only has like a week of being president left is because the cost/benefit of doing so is now so low it's worth just winning the left-winger brownie points.
