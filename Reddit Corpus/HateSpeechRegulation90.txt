Title: Streamlining content. How much is to much

Post:
Hey guys. If you were going to follow someone on socials, and they posted content such as fashion, at skate parks as well as on trains, would you not follow them because it's not just the 1 location/vibe? I spend a lot of time in both areas, and are looking to grow my socials by streamlining down a bit. Currently super random and no growth.Thanks
