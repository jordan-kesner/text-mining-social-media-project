Just an FYI, I knew I wouldn't get an honest response to the facts here... the fact that an unregulated model allows for bad actors to take advantage of the system is clearly demonstrated... but hey, why respond to and face the facts when you can just deflect, prevaricate, or evade the topic all together AMIRITE?
If it's a truly unbiased marketplace of ideas, Socialist groups on FB will have so much more energy than any Libertarian quote machine, so I'm down.
Why is an unregulated model "the" libertarian model. The libertarian model is that as a property owner, I decide what content I want on my system. The non-libertarian model is that someone else (usually government) tells me what I have to put on my site. 

So, if Facebook wants no moderation and it hurts their profitability and they impose rules that make people want to use the site more, that's perfectly in line with libertarianism IMO. 

Now, to the extent a content provider makes changes because of the implied threat of government intervention, then you have a non-libertarian solution being imposed on the property owner and that's bad. 
Ok, let’s get rid of free speech.  Let the government control what’s said.  That always works pretty well from what I’ve seen.
