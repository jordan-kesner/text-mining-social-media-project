Title: CMV: Liberals, particularly younger ones, are at least as intolerant as their conservative counterparts.

Post:
I conducted my own personal CMV on reddit over the past two months in response to my conservative friends' claims that liberals, particularly on social media (which is dominated by 13-30 aged persons), are "just as bad". I concluded with dismay they were right. I have seen political censorship on a breathtaking scale. Many subreddits ban submissions linking to even reputable conservative news organisations. Youth supporting setting fires on their own campuses to protest Milo coming to debate. Despite over 1/3rd of this age group self-reporting as conservative, nearly none of what makes the front page represents them. Facebook and Google have both claimed to be cracking down on "fake news" with algorithms. Few question the fairness of its results or ask for details on how they work. Anti-abuse and reporting systems are, themselves, frequently abused to silence others. 


I truly wish they were wrong, but I have seen little to support the assertion that social media is an echo chamber of political correctness and populism. Change my view, Reddit.

Addendum: 


My time here is up, but I may reply to a few more of you. I'd like to thank everyone who commented on my post. An overwhelming majority of you gave thoughtful responses, and I hope I was able to give equally thoughtful replies to everyone. Considering the inherently controversial nature of my post, the conversations today were insightful and gave me some things to think about. For further, have a listen to Elie Wiesel's [The Perils of Indifference](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/ewieselperilsofindifference.html), a remarkable look back from a Holocaust survivor on the consequences of apathy towards the plights of others. Have a great 4th of July!

You suggest a series of things that require some sort of substantiation. 

> I have seen political censorship on a breathtaking scale.

First, if you want to have a reasoned argument, don't resort to hyperbole. Subreddits are concentrators for people of congruent interests. Not posting stuff from the Weekly Standard in a liberal sub is not political censorship - especially considering subreddits make no claims to be open an objective in the first place. 

>Many subreddits ban submissions linking to even reputable conservative news organisations.

That is their prerogative.  But more to the point, you have to be specific. Which subs? What constitutes "reputable"? Are you sure they are banned and not just disincentivized because the population of the sub isn't interested in that material? 

>Youth supporting setting fires on their own campuses to protest Milo coming to debate.

What youth supports this? Are you sure they support this *specific* statement? Most people are not so irrational as to support premeditated destruction as a means of protest regardless of what's being protested.  

>Despite over 1/3rd of this age group self-reporting as conservative, nearly none of what makes the front page represents them. 

The Internet is populated by more than just millennials and those who are outside of that group are very likely to be liberal. It should come as a shock to no one that much of the collective opinion of the internet is liberal as a result. 

Social media is a popularity contest. It is not a proportional representation of the users behind the screens. If the user base of the internet was 51% liberal and 49% conservative, you would still see a majority of posts being liberal as a result. 

>Facebook and Google have both claimed to be cracking down on "fake news" with algorithms. Few question the fairness of its results or ask for details on how they work. 

This doesn't have anything to do with liberal or conservative. It *implies* that Google and Facebook are going to censor conservative media under the auspices of cracking down on "fake news" but you have no reason to believe that. The proliferation of "fake news" in the last election cycle speaks to exactly the opposite conclusion. 

>Anti-abuse and reporting systems are, themselves, frequently abused to silence others.

In what way does this argument imply conservatives are being suppressed? 

>I have seen little to support the assertion that social media is an echo chamber of political correctness and populism

People populate echo chambers of their own choosing and they do so willingly. 

But that is completely beside the point.

Nothing you've said even argues to the point that young liberals are intolerant except, perhaps, the point about setting fire to campus - which I find dubious in the extreme. 

All you've demonstrated is social media tends to reflect it's liberal majority. That's not intolerance. 

Like many people, you're conflating intolerance for human beings with intolerance for intolerance itself. A lot of young liberal people are quite militant, but they are militant against harmful and bigoted ideas. Conservatives on the other hand, are bigoted against entire groups of people based on their sex, race, and religion. Yes, sometimes liberals are overly sensitive and see bigotry where it doesn't exist, but that doesn't make them just as if not more intolerant than conservatives who literally want to deny people equal rights.

You bring up the young liberals who were setting fires on campus to protest Milo, but you don't seem to even know why they were doing it. It's not just that his views conflict with their own. It's because last time he had a speaking engagement on a campus he put up a picture of a transgender student on the projector during his talk and talked about how much he wanted to fuck her. He then planned on outing students who were undocumented immigrants at Berkley during his talk, and that's why people protested him coming. It's not merely the difference of opinion. It's bigotry that liberals won't tolerate.

Take it from someone who grew up in Mississippi. I was a black sheep in my hometown my entire life because I was an atheist and my mom was a stripper. You don't know intolerance until you grow up surrounded by nothing but uptight, Bible-thumping conservatives. There is a reason people who live in diverse communities tend to be more liberal, and people who live in small towns with little diversity tend to be more conservative. No way in hell liberal college students on my campus are every bit as intolerant as small-minded rednecks who've lived in the same town all their lives.

In short, conservatives have low tolerance for people different than them, and liberals have low tolerance for ideas they view as archaic and harmful towards vulnerable people. It becomes less an issue of opposing views and more an issue of your views harming people.
In many cases, liberals are intolerant of intolerant expression.  It's like not wanting the Westboro baptist people around: we should preserve free expression but hateful rhetoric really detracts from society. Similarly, Milo tends to belittle many groups like those on government assistance and immigrants.

It is intolerance, but I think saying gays shouldn't marry and people should go back to their own countries is objectively worse.
I think you might be taking the term 'Liberals' bit too far. If you're referring to far-left wing activists then yes, most of my friends who would fit that description tend to have a great intolerance of differing opinions, enough to cut off communications if you present counter-arguments. But... The far right are no better, they don't even start discussions online to begin with. The vast majority of millennials are neither far-left nor far-right though, and most people in my generation can have civilized debate without resorting to expletives and ALL CAP RANTS. The polite and well thought out discussions never make the news though.
Confirmation bias isn't a political but a human characteristic; we find information that proves us right more than information that proves us wrong. There are, however, [differences](http://www.firstpersonpolitics.com/confirmation-bias-how-the-left-resists-it-and-the-right-enlists-it/) in how confirmation bias plays out in left- and right-wing brains. The left, for instance has a much higher tolerance for ambiguity, complexity, and new experiences, and are much more likely to be self-critical, attempting to understand their own biases and work against them.

If you are basing your impressions of the left and right off of political debates on Reddit, during the first year of the Trump presidency, yeah, your going to encounter a lot of panicked reactionary anger. Try to look at conversations where politics is not at the fore. Religion for example: yeah there are a lot of atheists who are just as fundamentalist as anyone, but if you're agnostic, or Unitarian(believes all religions offer a path to the truth) or a Universalist(believe in the end everyone will be saved) it's very likely your left leaning politically.
Or look at history. Look at the people who challenged intolerance and blind assumptions, and championed the new and different. Can you think of any historic conservative famous for defending a minority group they did not belong to? And did so without allying themselves with liberals?
Both right and left will delude themselves if it supports their repertoire of values. But a key leftist value is tolerance for the different and new. 
I'm a liberal and have been accused of being intolerant by conservatives before now. These accusations come after I've had a discussion with them where they are stating something provably untrue to support their political allegiance.  For example "We should kick out all the Muslim's because they're all terrorists", or "All immigrants are only here to steal our welfare".  When I see conservatives complaining about their freedom of speach being restricted it's almost always because people are trying to point out that what they are saying is totally factually wrong (admittedly this isn't always done in a constructive, educational manner), not because people are trying to restrict their freedom of speach.  Some of the left-wing conspiracy theory crowd are guilty of exactly the same thing and also have a tendancy to start shouting about censorship when somebody tries to correct them. There is a difference between trying to stop lies being spread and trying to censor somebody expressing their political beliefs.
I haven't looked through everything in the thread, so my apologies if someone already touched on this.

While I think that you are correct in some ways, I don't believe your stance is propped up on a sturdy platform - I think you've made a few assumptions and missed a few things that are a part of the bigger picture. I think George Carlin said it best, however I can't find the exact quote or a video with the exact clip so I will need to paraphrase:

> There are a few good people, and a whole lot of assholes.

I think the main problem with your stance is that you've come to accept "Liberals are *also* intolerant", but fact-of-the-matter is, being loud and intolerant really doesn't have much to with being Liberal **or** Conservative - it's about different types of people. As Carlin was getting at is that if you take any cross-section of any subsection of a given population you will likely find very similar results: A few decent human beings, a bunch of "whatevers", and a whole lot of assholes.

Likewise, if you take any cross-section of any group of a given population, you're going to find loud, out-spoken individuals who happen to be intolerant. It-just-so-happens, however, that people who are intolerant **and** out-spoken are going to try to make their voices heard, and they will sometimes be assholes about it. So for any given social media interaction, you're going to eventually find someone who is out-spoken and intolerant - it's just a fact of life. This will happen for any subsection, group, label, or affiliation - it has nothing to do with Liberal or Conservative - I bet you can find someone who is intolerant of My Little Pony, or someone who is outspoken and a complete asshole about people who like Star Wars for some stupid reason. There was a lady in my neighborhood growing up who was a Jehovah and *hated* Christmas, and was the biggest fucking ~~cunt~~ Scrooge and would yell and complain about people putting up lights and how bad it looked and that it should all be taken down.

It really doesn't have anything to do with Liberals or Conservatives. **Of course** you're going to find Liberals who are outspoken and intolerant - you'll find those kinds of people belonging to **any** group you come across. But just because a few loud assholes exist doesn't mean that it is in any way representative of the entire group of people - that is to say, you can't draw actual conclusions such as, "Liberals are [at least/more/less] intolerant as Conservatives" because you don't have any actual data, just your specific interactions with a small part of an entire group. It's like the saying, "The few ruin it for the whole" - a loud fraction of a group may make it sound like Liberals are less tolerant than they actually might be. So it's not safe to draw conclusions about *either side* based on that, as you are only looking at the fraction of individuals who like to speak out on the internet and on social media - which is not *all* people belonging to those groups.
Do you honestly believe that anonymous posts on an internet forum are a reliable sample of political beliefs and proclivities?
By "intolerant" you primarily mean (for the purpose of this post) intolerant of conservative views/arguments and pro-censorship of those views/arguments? In other words, will not tolerate the free expression of non-liberal views?
Any given liberal can be just as intolerant as any given conservative.

However, when you look at the actual data, conservatives (as a whole) are far less tolerant than liberals (as a whole) are of dissenting views. 


MIT analyzed those who followed Trump and Hillary on Twitter and looked at who else they followed. It turned out that Trump followers were far more likely to cluster and exclusively follow the same sources, while Hillery followers were more likely to follow people from a broad political spectrum.

Pew Research ran a large study where they surveyed the preferences of liberals and conservatives on whom they prefer to live with and interact with. Conservatives consistently showed a stronger desire to be with people who thought like them than did liberals

I think many moderate liberals want to be able to say that both sides are the same since it appeals to a liberal sense of fairness, but that option is not supported by the data. The data shows that liberals are, in fact, more tolerant than conservatives.
