This server was obviously untrained in the unique form of sensitivity used in today's service industry.

We call them "the Swiss", to avoid shit like this.
How come people seem to completely forget the "social" aspect of social media...then they act all bewildered because there are consequences to the stupid things they say. 
Wrong. The government is far more limited in the restrictions and the attending punishments that it can place on expressive acts than are entities within the private sector. Private companies cannot jail or imprison anyone. That can only occur when you violate laws enacted and enforced by the government. 
If blacks tipped better and didn't run you back and forth for bs all night, the complaint wouldn't be made. 
Welcome to the world of "Big Brother" where mean thoughts will get you arrested.  Better tow the line and develop the politically correct view or suffer the consequences.
