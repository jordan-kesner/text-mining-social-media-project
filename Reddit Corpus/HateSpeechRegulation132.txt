Title: /r/UkrainianConflict: Information, Breaking News, Live Updates and Discussion on the Ukrainian Crisis

Post:
At **/r/UkrainianConflict** we are dedicated to providing a revolutionary form of coverage: crowd-sourced news. 

/r/UkrainianConflict is built on the premise that coverage of global events can be of a higher quality, faster and more in-depth if we embrace the concept of crowd-sourcing user-generated-content (social media, foreign language articles, verified video and photographs) as well as aggregating traditional media.

Our moderating team is committed to fostering an informed and civil discussion of the facts; we try to limit poorly evidenced, emotive or biased submissions. 

If you want to keep up-to-date on Ukrainian coverage, the moderating team at /u/UkrainianConflict urges you to come and join the conversation

**Background on the /r/UkrainianConflict moderating team**

Using our experience covering the Syrian conflict, (most of us also moderate over at /r/syriancivilwar,) we have learned how to skeptically embrace social media. Read about our work here: [How the Syrian War Subreddit Scoops Mainstream Media](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/07/how-the-syrian-war-subreddit-scoops-mainstream-media.html) and see a [summary here](http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/1vozl9/summary_of_rsyriancivilwars_work/)

So we have a conflict. Checked.

Seems like all the ingredients of a World War.  
I hope this remains at the state of joke.
This looks more like an ad for /r/Ukraineconflict that it does a thread to educate people or gather links for what is happening in the Ukraine. 
Basically write now Russian troops have invaded into the Crimea, a region in eastern Ukraine. The crimea consists primarily of people who are ethnically Russian (And speak Russian) who are upset because the old president (Yanukovich, who got kicked out by protests) has been removed and the new powers in parliment are primarily pro-western/nationalist. So the Crimea is probably down with the invasion (Although I'm still calling it an invasion). Here's some legit sources.

tl:dr Russia invaded part of the Ukraine that might want to be part of Russia, the Ukraine/Europe/US can't do anything about it.
I just saw a post on my newsfeed from somebody in the Australian Navy saying they were being deported to the Southern Ukrainian Border.. what does this mean?
Look on the bright side if something does happen the us economy will pick up again as the saying goes if Americas economy sneezes Europe catches a cold
