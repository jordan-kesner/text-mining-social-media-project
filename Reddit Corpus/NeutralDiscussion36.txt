Title: How large of an impact has social media had on politics?

Post:
In our social media enveloped culture how has the instant availability of information changed the political landscape of the U.S. or the world at large? Have the changes social media brought about benefited our political culture or hindered it, maybe even setting it back?

In many ways it hurts democracy, because it gives every whacko a platform to spread whatever bullshit they have with ease. The one saving grace to that is that social media is not real life. People in real life behave (and vote) differently than what social media would have you believe
Massive. Not just the access but how easy it is to speed misinformation and manipulated media, much of it driven by AI. Andrew Yang spoke about this with Nina Shick recently, very informative.
The older generation has not learned how to navigate the internet. They are very susceptible to disinformation campaigns of which are very popular on platforms like Facebook/Twitter etc...

It's both. Its easier to look at social media as two parts: the platform and the algorithm. I personally feel the platform as benefited society as large as it drastically reduces the barrier of entry for speakers and allows many issues that might have been ignored to be, at least, seen. Prior to social media minority groups were at the mercy of gatekeepers. Keep in mind that this entry of barrier is lowered for fact checkers and opponents too. So there is a form of check and balance in play here. The damaging aspect is algorithm. Algorithms are dangerous and damaging because it actively removes information which the user can see and quickly promotes a passing idea into a firm ideology with zero input from neutral or opposing views.
I once had a political science professor who believed that one of the reasons the Founding Fathers thought a large republic would work is that no one person could dominate the debate. People would have to approach debates and issues with various types of points of view. With so many different, but controlled, types of opinions, extreme, erroneous ideas would be filtered out.

**Social media ruins that.** *There are no gatekeepers.* One dude in Alabama types "death panels" on Facebook, shares that with his family and friends, and they share that with their family and friends, and in an instant the entire country is either pro or con "death panels." An article in a Pulitzer-prize winning newspaper nowadays holds the same, *if not less,* value than a viral post on Reddit/Twitter/Facebook that **that isn't even real.**

The average person simply doesn't possess the ability to be media literate. *Maybe* 10% of people can teach themselves to be remotely critical about the information they see or the sources that get in front of them, the other 90% just can't, *or won’t*, do it. 

Decades of written and unwritten rules of journalism are being thrown out the window by the truckload. The average joe who writes a politically charged post on these platforms is not beholden to them. They'll write or publish the most salacious stories they find to whatever [outrage porn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc&feature=youtu.be&app=desktop&persist_app=1) sub or Facebook group of their preference for the sheer goal of making people angry and [divided.](http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/)

And people are *angry*. People subscribe to echo chambers and are fed a daily stream of alarmist garbage that serves no intellectual purpose other than to confirm their own beliefs. Do you believe black people are subhuman scum? Here’s 50 instances of a black person committing a crime. Do you believe women are all slanderous whores? 35 false rape accusation stories coming right up. Do you believe vaccines cause neurological disorders? Here’s 300 wine moms on Facebook, a [celebrity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt5HTA9MkkY&app=desktop) (and one actual [“doctor”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield)) saying the same thing, therefore it *must* be true right? 

This is what most social media platforms do. It provides a pile of anecdotal "evidence" to support any opinions you want now matter how nonsensical they may be. 

Depressed, impressionable young men watch PewDiePie and Joe Rogan and [eventually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmRYRRDbuw) wake up with 12 breaking news stories on their feed about how the white race is being wiped out. They log onto their youtube channels to watch hours of white supremacist rants about how Feminism is ruining their preferred artform of choice. Then they wind down in the evening by cathartically partaking in a twitter feud, half them stoking their fellow believers into a frenzy, half lashing out at whatever non-desirable group of the week. Humans don't process statistics well, so piling up anecdotes is a frighteningly effective way to amplify our core xenophobic natures.

In my opinion social media and the internet as it exists today is delivering such a destructive blow to our democratic institutions that we ought to be asking ourselves whether they will even survive. An educated, independent populace with critical thinking skills is the only way to dissuade mass misinformation in the Information Age, and America doesn’t have that.
I just watched “The Social Dilemma” on NF. While NF documentaries aren’t a good source of information I do agree with the claim that social media manipulates our subconscious in ways we don’t understand. It changes who we are, what we believe, and makes it extremely difficult to know what is real truth and what isn’t. They say if we all can’t agree on what is actually truth we can’t make sound decisions as a whole society. We become polarized and angry that others don’t see things how we see things because in reality they AREN’T seeing what we see. They have a completely different algorithm with different “information” and opinions. Echo chamber at its finest.
I feel that social media hurts elections and makes them feel more vicious. Since everyone is one click away from news and opinions people become obsessed with it. I’m 17 and hate how people act when it comes to elections. I hate how toxic it feels and makes me want to avoid it entirely. It’s helped with getting people involved and that’s great, but it sometimes feels more like a sports match then civil discussion.
Social media I find brings out the worst in people for one, and easily manipulates the narrative. Flat earthers existed before, but now that there is social media they can become more prevalent than ever before. It also makes people more one sided. It has had a hugely negative impact on politics.
It’s definitely dumbed down the language of our politicians to fit into bite-sized messages. Although, I’d argue it’s less to do with social media, and more to do with information overload. The abundance of platforms, information, and entertainment options have made it harder for political entities to capture our attention.
The impact of social media can be seen of the tense fissure that we have in ideological politics. Social media has been the battle ground for foreign operatives to spread misinformation to fuel the constant tensions in American identity politics.
