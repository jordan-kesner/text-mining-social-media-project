Title: Biggest r/politics censorship yet: As a result of posts highlighting the inconsistent and unfair censorship in r/politics, cheney_healthcare (me) has been banned from that subreddit. Huge post inside.

Post:
As the title alludes, I have been banned from r/politics. Not because of my behavior in the subreddit, but because I have been a critic of the discretionary, inconsistent, and what I believe to be a biased moderation regime which started ~3 months ago. The moderators themselves admit I have been banned for alleged "shit stirring", amongst other inaccurate descriptions and justifications they have used.



This is a very long post, my spelling and grammar may not be so great, and any respectful discussion is welcomed. Also, perhaps it's not the biggest censorship (sorry if it sounds like too much grandeur!) Here goes....



In this post I will:



- Talk briefly about my presence on this site.



- Show the audience the messages I received including the reasoning for been banned.



- I will tear apart the reasoning from the moderators, which I believe to be a gross distortion of reality used to justify the ban (edit: actually, they are straight-up **lying**). I will also highlight some of the language used, and a few other points which I find interesting.



- I will post my entire private message history with #politics (the moderators) to show that I have always tried to be respectful, and engage the r/politics moderators before bring up grievances with the greater community.



- I will encourage the mods to actually engage in public discussion regarding this issue.



- Topics I haven't covered, but intend to in the future.



- Immediate steps forward.



First thing though, I want this conversation to remain as civil as possible and for everyone to avoid making things unnecessarily personal. I'd also like to highlight that I greatly appreciate the work that each and every person puts into an online community such as this one. All the way from the admins and developers to the moderators and people who comment and vote on posts. (as long as they aren't republicans... just kidding) I've had some great conversations with people here whom have opposite points of view, and think if all of society could talk out their differences and find common ground we would all be better for it. So enough disclaimer, onto the show:



My presence on this site
---------------------------------------



I enjoy debate, and I enjoy a wide variety of ideas and ideals. I'd like to feel like I contribute a humble voice to this site, and I seem to get lots of good feedback from others on the site. I like many others I believe that we as a society are far from been in ideal circumstances and think that the best step forward for humanity are education and tolerance. As well as using reddit as an avenue to expand my own personal knowledge and wisdom, I also like to engage in debate with people of all types and try to get others to think a little differently. This means I take on board other ideas as well as attempting to spread my own. I feel my ideas and mind is still a early stage of development, and talking about them with people who agree and disagree is a great way to help me refine my political, moral, and philosophical compass. Just today, this post http://www.reddit.com/r/TheAgora/comments/l3hcg/the_trolley_problem/ in r/TheAgora blew my mind a little, and made me feel even more lost in the realm of ideas and ideals. I like that feeling, as it is a gateway to greater understanding.



With the US presidential election almost ramping up into full swing, I find myself in many discussions about the issues that affect this country. In 2008 I was firmly behind Dennis Kucinich, Mike Gravel, and Ron Paul. While all three weren't quite my 100% ideal, I'd strongly consider giving up beer for 10 years if it would lead to one of these men as president. Although their ideas differ in different areas, I value honesty in politicians above all else (and giving up beer is a big deal!) As Obama is a given this time, we only get to really shape the election in terms of the republicans, this has led me to put my full support behind Ron Paul and Gary Johnston. With Paul, I am amazed at the efforts people go to in order to spread smear and misinformation. The amount of trolls in Ron Paul threads also amazes me and I have at least 10 regular ones chase me around this site. This c nstant relaying of misinformation leads to many uninformed people parroting these distortions. As a result much of my time on this site lately has been that of defending the man and trying to educate others. This wasn't really something I saw myself doing, but I kind of fell into it, and although sometimes I'd rather go and play outside, I feel that I have a duty to help others be educated and more tolerant of other opinons. If you asked any of my friends if they would expect me to be spending hours defending a Christian Republican from Texas who likes guns but not abortion, they would think you were mad. Although on this site I have been branded a libertarian, and libertarians generally find me more agreeable to a greater extent than a lot of the site, my political views are quite nucassened and middle of the road.



As a result of the time I spend here, I get many 'thankyou' messages which are a great motivator. I've also had reddit gold bought for me a few times as well. It expired briefly a month ago, but via some more generosity lately, I've still got another year left (please don't get me any more! Perhaps get some for your favorite mod of a subreddit you frequent.) I like to believe that I will happily engage in respectful debate with anyone for hours at a time if they wanted to, and this is with anyone at all of any persuasion. 



Given the above, I am somewhat a stubborn bastard. If I believe you are acting in an unfair way or being an asshole, I'll call you out for it, and I'll also spend time countering your efforts. Evidence can be found in r/shill (which I now moderate). If anyone has problems with anything there, once I'll happily discuss them with you.



Part of this unfairness has been the treatment of posts which sit outside of your average r/politics opinion, with a great focus on those about Ron Paul. Although I have an admitted pro-Paul bias, it seems from posts I have made, and feedback I have been given, that many other people feel that as of the recent r/politics mod changes that censorship has become a real issue. To compound this issue, some of the misinformation/lies/distortions regarding Ron Paul have been actively perpetuated by people which are meant to moderate this subreddit.



While I have taken exception to this, and been active in highlighting any issues I see, I would think it would be more than reasonable to say that I try to stay as fair as possible, and will engage in respectful debate with anyone who chooses to do the same.



The current foo-foo relating to this has put me where I am right now, which is banned from r/politics:

you have been banned from posting to Politics.



**to andrewinmelbourne sent 11 hours ago**



Any particular reason?



**from andrewinmelbourne (_) [+1] sent 11 hours ago**



Generally shit stirring and mod bashing. If you don't like how the subreddit is run, start your own.

and then



----------------------



**An explanation of why you have been banned from /r/poltics [+] from PoliticsMod sent 11 hours ago**



First, let this be utterly clear: in no way was this done as a result of your opinions. This action has come about from your continued harassment of the moderators and unshakable belief in a conspiracy to prevent you from fully participating. Instead of speaking politely with us regarding your submissions that may have been blocked or spam filtered, you have contemptuously and arrogantly demanded action and protested when biased links were removed. However, being banned has come about as a result of your continual attempts to raise a mob against the leadership of /r/politics. We have always fairly enforced our policies, even if you disagree with them. If your participation in the subreddit is going to cause such trouble, we'd simply rather not have your contributions.



Should your behavior change, we may be willing to reverse the ban.

Top Comments:
I would be more sympathetic to the mods side of the story if they ever said once that they weren't responsible for taking down your articles.

With their willingness to respond and communicate with you and others with similar complaints, it would seem natural for a "we didn't do that" to have come into conversation.

I know I sound a bit GlennBeck-like to say the absence of a denial is proof of guilt, but that's not precisely what I mean.  I'd just like to hear a straight "We didn't delete your articles" or a "We did delete them, here's why...".
> However, being banned has come about as a result of your continual attempts to raise a mob against **the leadership of /r/politics.**

They're moderators. They aren't supposed to be leading anything.

>If you don't like how the subreddit is run, start your own.

I'd be more alright with this attitude from a mod if it weren't a subscribed-by-default subreddit.

edit: apparently it turns out I just wasn't aware that a subreddit of a certain size is autosubscribed. My bad.
Cheney Healthcare, it would seem that your friends from /r/politics have followed you over here. Fear not brave soul, being banned from /r/politics is like being banded from the retard club. It is something all of us should try for...

Speaking of that, I'll be right back..
While I agree that the situation is bullshit, everybody at this point knows that /r/politics is the most idiotic and crooked place on Reddit.

I really wish you guys wouldn't waste your time worrying about that place.
I will tear apart the reasoning from the moderators, which I believe to be a gross distortion of reality used to justify the ban. I will also highlight some of the language used, and a few other points which I find interesting.

First of all, the post from andrewinmelbourne.



Now I have never encountered this redditor before, so it's kind of interesting that he was the one to execute the ban, his comment of: 



> Generally shit stirring and mod bashing. If you don't like how the subreddit is run, start your own.



If I didn't have any grievances, I wouldn't say anything. In fact, it's only since this new moderation regime that I have had any issues. I truly believe that my problems are legitimate, and many other users seem to affirm this. As for 'mod bashing', besides some disagreements with PHOY, and perhaps some critique of the alternet posts by davidreiss666, I don't believe I have ever engaged in 'bashing'. And to even use that word seems to be an unfair characterization. Are the people at OWS just 'bank bashing'? Were the anti-war movement just 'military-bashing'? This is a weasel word to remove any legitimacy which I may have, but this isn't really the post I am concerned with.....

The post from 'PoliticsMod' or ('anonymous' r/politics moderator)

-------------------------------



> First, let this be utterly clear: in no way was this done as a result of your opinions. This action has come about from your continued harassment of the moderators and unshakable belief in a conspiracy to prevent you from fully participating.



What is being made clear is that my ability to post and communicate in r/politics has been removed. As for the "continued harassment of the moderators" this is an **absolute bullshit** claim, one which I will defend by uploading EVERY SINGLE PRIVTE COMMENT to imgur for your own eyes. I have always tried to remain respectful and not make things personal. What you will also find by my messages is that there is 17 queries over a period of 90 days, all which were regarding spamfiltered posts. 



The fact 'PoliticsMod' would accuse me of harassment is another unfair characterization straight off the bat. This claim is absolute trash, and blown out of all proportion to help justify silencing me in r/politics.



The mod here is saying that it's not a result of my 'opinions', but in fact, it is entirely the result of my opinons, as this accusation and the next one have no legs to stand on, and the result of this ban is that I am unable to share opinions nor post with the r/politics community at all.



> and unshakable belief in a conspiracy to prevent you from fully participating.



I haven't used the word conspiracy, nor have I made any claim that it is to prevent me from participating. (although, I have now been banned from participating). What my concerns relate to is the inconsistent censorship and policies which have emerged over the last few months. This statement again is just another attempt to set up a strawman of what I am 'apparently' doing so they can knock it down. This is again a mischaracterization.



> Instead of speaking politely with us regarding your submissions that may have been blocked or spam filtered, you have contemptuously and arrogantly demanded action and protested when biased links were removed. 



As you will see below, I have tried to engage with the mods in discussion, but my posts have been ignored. The last post which I made (which is the one that lead to this ban) I have the mods 1 day+ to respond to my query, when that failed I posted to the greater community. As for my links as 'biased', I genuinely don't believe this, and in most cases, I haven't done anything about the ban. I challenge the r/politics moderators to show where I have 'arrogantly demanded action' over 'biased links'. 



> However, being banned has come about as a result of your continual attempts to raise a mob against the leadership of /r/politics.



Is Occupy Wall St a protest? Or a mob? It's easy to deride any protest against someone's actions as a 'mob' to create the impression of thug-like tactics. My problem isn't with the 'leadership', but with the actions. The actions is what I have an issue with, the actions are what I have highlighted, and the actions are what I would like to see changed. I also find it interesting that PoliticsMod uses the word 'leadership', as if to say that the mods should be the ones 'leading' discussion, and 'leading' the posting. Do the mods really consider themselves to be the 'leaders'?



> We have always fairly enforced our policies, even if you disagree with them. 



There are NUMEROUS examples where moderation and censorship have been inconsistent. My post yesterday highlights this. As mentioned, when I am on reddit I try to be civil, but I'll be the first to admit that I have my 'moments'. To try to claim that the policies are 'always fairly enforced' is pigheaded to say the least.



> If your participation in the subreddit is going to cause such trouble, we'd simply rather not have your contributions.



Perhaps I am hearing wrong, but this statement says to me: "If you are doing to take issue with the censorship, you will be censored 100%."



-----------------------------------------------------



TL;DR (the last bit): The justification used for the ban is almost totally fabricated. Events have purposely being mischaracterized in order to fit a narrative which suites their decision. This is my strong opinion, and as always, feel free to discuss.



I will post my entire private message history with #politics (the moderators) to show that I have always tried to be respectful, and engage the r/politics moderators before bring up grievances with the greater community.

I think I have got them all, and hopefully I haven't mixed up the images/links/etc when preparing this. I encourage any moderator to highlight any inaccuracies or omissions if there are any. From this collection it should be clear that the charge of 'harassment' and 'arrogance regarding biased links' is a completely unfounded charge. As I said before, I do have my moments, but on the overall I think it will be found that I am polite and encourage respectful discussion.
