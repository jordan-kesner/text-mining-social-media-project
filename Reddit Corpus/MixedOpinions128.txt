Title: Is "Ukraine Aid" really even the impeachable offense anymore?

Post:
**As of 4 Days ago --- This is no longer about "Ukraine" at all for me. This is about how DJT is running his government -- and Ukraine is just an example of where he got caught doing it.**

To me it is no longer even  remotely about the Foreign Country....It's POTUS using his own personal agents, with no accountability to conduct US policy. (Now very much established by Parnas-tapes and Bolton if you believe him)

For example -- FISA or Biden - maybe was corrupt - and please investigate. But those were done officially through official channels by people subject to Subpoenas, FOIA, etc....and the oversight of the other 2 branches of Government. That is why it can been investigated.

This an Executive hiring his own random people, in back-door deals (looking like all orchestrated out of Trump hotel in DC) to conduct US intelligence and state activity. (basically - "Drug Deals" as Bolton put it.)

(**EDIT 1: TO CLARIFY THE ABOVE: Private citizens, foreigner, and others are ALL OKAY - AS LONG AS THEY ARE ON THE RECORD (and thus accountable if something goes wrong and needs to be investigated and de-classified to the investigators). Top secret is still on the record.**

**Bolton's and Parnas' stories are saying (I want to hear from people to confirm, and if Trump can show otherwise), that what Trump was doing was 100% off-the-record -- not classified intel/state activity. Those are very different things.**

***If you have evidence of another Executive getting caught running a substantial part of the Gov't through his own non-gov't contracted/unaccountable people -- and it being approved/ignored, I would love to see it.***   **I am not a partisan -- I will call that Corruption and the exact swamp that needs to be fixed. I don't care what party you are -- I am sick of the self-serving self-dealing bullshit -- BUT I can 100% can assure you, the answer to that is not giving the Executive un-checked authority to do it himself, off the record, with no accountability.*****)***

**(EDIT 2***:  Nepotism (Biden shit just as an example), Foundations (Clinton and Trump as examples), PACs and various other forms of LEGAL but dirty as fuck politics (where people can funnel money/favors into Politicians personal lives, campaigns, and families)  are horrible and need to be addressed. I want that shit out of Gov't.**

**But that is not what Trump is doing here or what he is really going after. He's not using his Executive to shut down and push to reform that type of Corruption -- he is instead engaging in a far more dangerous and far more corrupt form of shadow government to selectively target partisan Corruption scandals.**

**The Answer is not giving an Executive growing power, to be used in secret unofficial gov't (with no accountability) to go after the other side. (That fucking terrifies me, and will be a partisan shit-show.)**

**The Answer is a complete overhaul of our Corruption laws to get this TECHNICALLY LEGAL PAY-TO-PLAY Bullshit out of Federal Gov't.** 

**I have a lot of ideas on how to START do that (I by no means have anywhere near all the answers). And I am in the process of writing a more thorough "Platform" for my idea. I plan to post a major post on it some time in the next week or so -- time permitting.**

**The heart of it would be a full overhaul of the laws about -- Nepotism (Biden shit just as an example), Foundations (Clinton and Trump as examples), PACs and various other forms of LEGAL but dirty as fuck politics (where people can funnel money/favors into Politicians personal lives, campaigns, and families).**

**And a complete overhaul of our CIA/NSA (and other "secret" gov't) oversight.**

**My idea (name is not set, but i like it):** ***The Anti-Corruption Party: For Democratic Liberty and Reasoned Policy (Shorthand: Democratic Libertarians or The ACP))***

What else has Trump done we have no idea about - because no one but his own personal agents know about it?

The ball is now 100% in the Senate's Court to Demand Witnesses. And force Trump to officially go on the record with his Privilege argument (and Force another Nixon-like SCOTUS case)

I honesty think this last 4 days may change everything (since the Parnas tape).

I think SCOTUS will hear this Witness case immediately when it gets there. ( I have never been one to think Trump was actually "finished this time" - he is Teflon Don, and a lot of left/media spin made it easy to dismiss the truth in some of his failings.)

BUT NOW -- This is our Country's foundation we are talking about now - and the Chief Justice is overseeing this trial -- I think he will push this fast.

I 100% trust that Roberts truly believes in Country over Party. I disagree with him a lot -- but I think he is an honorable man that truly wants America to be the global gold standard for a Free Democratic nation.

I think Trump is either done -- or his supporters in the Senate are going to have to openly state that they support unaccountable Dictator-like running of the Executive, and think our Constitution and Gov't framework is meaningless. (and if they do these -- I hope that the 2020 election will be a reckoning for any of them in even remotely moderate states)

As long as there is reckoning in the 2020 Senate races if they do refuse to call witnesses or jut acquit after this is all confirmed by witnesses (I think 33 senate seats are up in 2020) -- my hope in our Democracy will live on. If they do -- and there is no reckoning in 2020...I am deeply worried about the Dictator-like power we just handed the executive -- regardless if a Dem takes WH in 2020.

If this obfuscation/obstruction succeeds and there is no Senate reckoning --- I don't care who wins WH in 2020 - I will be deeply concerned for our nation --- because I am not a partisan that puts party over the foundations of our democracy.

***Elected Reps are charged with upholding our Constitutional Democracy -- not caving to the whims of conspiracy theorists to support a POTUS flagrantly undermining the foundations of our Constitutional Democracy.***

Excellent write up.

But to answer your question:  Yes.  The development of further impeachable conduct doesn't in any way negate why we're here in the first place.

The justification for removing Trump is simply getting more and more obvious, and the consequences of failing to do so more dire.
> As of 4 Days ago --- This is no longer about "Ukraine" at all for me. This is about how DJT is running his government -- and Ukraine is just an example of where he got caught doing it.

heh.  When people claim "the libs wanted to impeach Trump from day one", that's not really true.  For me it was probably around the time the ... jesus, I can't remember when.  All the scandals are literally running together in my brain.  I want to say Comey's firing, but probably later than that.

> BUT NOW -- This is our Country's foundation we are talking about now - and the Chief Justice is overseeing this trial -- I think he will push this fast.

isn't he pretty much just a glorified emcee?

> I 100% trust that Roberts truly believes in Country over Party. I disagree with him a lot -- but I think he is an honorable man that truly wants America to be the global gold standard for a Free Democratic nation.

I'm not quite sure he had as much control over the process as you're making out.

One thing I will agree with, though... it's becoming harder and harder to support Trump from a moral standpoint.  People will have to go on the record, and that's not going to be a good look in the future.
I have to disagree here, at the risk of defending he-who-I-refuse-to-defend. I don't have a problem with his means of achieving his goals. His means are fine. Imagine a world where the official channels are fully corrupt and untrustworthy. In this ficticious world, I have no problem with a President, or any other government official, going outside normal channels. The problem here is the goal. Heck, don't even worry about morality here, just effectivity. What if there is a legitimate US policy that needs to be achieved and the only way is use outside channels? There are reasons to use unconventional means. The question is what are those means trying to achieve?
The lily-white understanding of government shows me that a lot of people haven't been following government until Trump got in office... Private people have always been involved in government affairs...
Its never been an impeachable offense, Trump can withhold US tax dollars from any foreign country he wants for any reason he wants.  That is his constitutional authority as the head of foreign policy.
Meh.  This is my view of all of it:

I never considered the Ukraine deal as foreign interference.  That’s a talking point.  It was corruption on Trumps part regardless of who he was blackmailing.  Ukraine was the unfortunate tool.

Since it had to do with shitty campaigning tactics and not vote corruption, buying votes, etc.  I have a hard time seeing it as worth removal.  I definitely think it was worthy of going through impeachment.  I see it on par with donation scandals or what I suspect was in Hill’s missing emails.

I think the House Dems are just as to blame as the Senate Reps will be for any future abuses of the Executive.  They had the chance to get to do this right and instead passed it on to the Senate for their own political positioning.  So once again the D’s failed their duty, left R’s with a shit choice, and democracy in the US dies a little.

If Trump were any other human he would make it through all this and be humbled by it by being remorseful and cautious.  I might be able to accept that.  But Trump is bombastic and will take it as a precedent to do more of the same.   

I don’t think wither side deserves a win out of this mess.
Indeed. But the obfuscation and Biden shit makes Ukraine a tougher sell as 100% impeachable offense.

This just makes the "Abuse of Power" charge look much cleaner now -- now this over-all abuse in how he ran the Executive, not about proving exactly what happened in Ukraine, or what was promised for what in return.

The "No evidence that Trump directed it personally" defense is now gone on the broader abuse claim.
Actually, although there will surely be legal wrangling over this and that, it's the broader view that is more important right now, imho. Each of these new bits of incriminating evidence that comes out is slowly tilting public opinion in favor of removal. I can't really say for sure but I believe this is the same way Nixon was forced out. 

While many of us are focused on all the minutae of the process, the less-involved, greater proportion of the population is hearing a steady stream of doubt-building sound bites. And this is exactly what needed to happen to give removal a chance - it had to become the people's will.

We're not there yet, and a major misstep could flip the whole trend, but right now the river of support is flowing to the left. It's pretty much guaranteed that Guiliani will try to grab the narrative back in his favor but I doubt he has anything real to offer. If he had they would have pulled it out by now. And his credibility is shot anyway. But Trump is going to get extremely desperate and there's no telling what he'll attempt to distract and diffuse.

I don't know if there's someone on the House side who is orchestrating this slow, steady campaign, but if there is, whomever she or he is, they're brilliant.
