So much to choose from in this List!  I'll start with one I'm familiar with to dispute.
> New data shares each Meta employee, on average, accounted for more than $1 million in revenue in the first half of 2024.

  Hogwash!  I had a Meta email address.  I was a CONTRACTOR working on adding games to Quest.  I ate Meta snacks and shat in Meta bathrooms.  There are floors and floors of us around the globe.  My hourly pay was Garbage.  We made Meta gazillions too.  So I'd re-figure that "mil per Employee quote".  I'll bet there's 6 contractors stashed some place for every one True meta employee.  So many contractors everywhere now.   No one works for the company they do work for anymore.  And they remind us everyday.  The free tampons in the men's room were always there to remind me I worked at Meta, but not Really.
