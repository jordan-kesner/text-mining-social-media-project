Title: CMV: Comment Flair Requirements on Subreddits where Free Speech is Championed are Hypocritical

Post:
There are many political subreddits. There are many political positions that do not value freedom of speech. There are many subreddits which require user flair to comment. I don't have a major problem with any of this except the following.

When a certain political position espouses the view that absolute or nearly absolute (maybe an exception for direct calls to violence or yelling "fire!" in a crowded theater for example) free speech is a core value, it ought not to restrict free speech as a matter of course. User flair requirements restrict freedom of speech. That's hypocritical. The action of restricting speech is not matching up with the value of preserving freedom of speech.

I do see reasons for mods to restrict speech. That's not what I'm saying. Requiring flair (i.e. being a "verified" holder of whatever set of beliefs users in the subreddit are meant to discuss) can:

* Ensure a certain objective attribute has been met (e.g. certified lawyer or minimum karma)
* Prevent excessive re-posting
* Prevent off-topic conversation
* Improve civility between users
* Reduce trolling
* Encourage good-faith discussion 

I do have a very minor general objection against all user flair requirements but I think it can be reasonably defended for one of the bulleted reasons above except in the above case where freedom of speech is a core value. The subreddit I had in mind was Conservative but there's several out there I have since discovered. CMV!

I'm not clear on how requiring a flair (when free and simple to add) interferes with freedom of speech.  You can still say whatever you want.  It's just like requiring a nametag.
Having some restrictions on comments in subreddits can actually be a pro freedom of speech move. Having no restrictions at all could easily result in bullying and harassment which would restrict people's freedom far more than having the rules would. If it's against the rules to shout at another user and call them racial slurs, then nothing of value was lost by banning that, and what's more, we've preserved the ability of people who did want to participate in good faith but might be discouraged or drowned out by the shouting bigots. So freedom of speech has actually been broadened by restricting it. I don't know if any subreddit uses flairs to achieve something like this, but this could be a good example of that rule actually being pro free speech.

That said r/conservative banned me for quoting a Muslim on the grounds that nobody should believe a Muslim and so I was a "credulous troll." So freedom of speech is not really one of their strong suits
Can you define freedom of speech? If you define it in such a way that your argument is circular,  it's hard to change your view.
I agree with that a good bit. An absolute free speech advocate, however, would say that bullying and harassment are consequences of truly fair speech. A nearly absolute free speech advocate would say as long as the bullying and harassment aren't physically harmful it ought to be allowed.

I do not see how banning certain speech increases the freedom strictly. Sure, others who felt attacked are more likely to speak their mind, but those who were doing the perceived attacking no longer have the ability to speak their mind. I'd say the value lost was that assholes can't be assholes (which isn't nothing, some might say it's a good thing).

As to your last paragraph, are you saying that freedom of speech is not a core conservative value? Because I don't know any conservatives personally (I know many) who would not say it is perhaps the central tenant of conservatism after rights to property and defense of said property.
Freedom of speech is the idea that one ought to be free to express their ideas no matter how heinous or unpopular they may be without fear of negative repercussions in the form of violence, lawsuits, etc. from either private or state actors.

How's my argument circular by the way?

I know; and I don't see how it interferes with freedom of speech at all.  What am I missing?  is there some detail about the flair requirements in some places that's different from what I expect?
