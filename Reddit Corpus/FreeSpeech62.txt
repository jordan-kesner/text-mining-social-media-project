I'm not interested in Big Tech censorship.  It is their websites so they do as they please.  That is called freedom.
Their censorship is so that the platform’s more palatable to advertisers. Also a government doing stuff isn’t communism you tool
But they aren't being allowed to "do as they please." They are getting pressure and even orders from government, as this sub documents.
As is now documented, the government is paying NGOs to organize advertiser boycotts. When the government "does stuff" to suppress speech, it's acting like a totalitarian government, so calling it "fascist" or "commie" is not wrong.

What NGO(s) are you referring to here?
There are many. A major one was the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), but they shut down once they got too much attention. Here's a whole article about it.
