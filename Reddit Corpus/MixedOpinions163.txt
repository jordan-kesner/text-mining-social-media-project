Title: CMV: Social pressures on men should be given equal coverage/concern as social pressures on women.

Post:
Much like women face social pressure to live up to beauty standards, men face social pressures to live up to standards of wealth, security, and mental toughness. However this unfair pressure rarely gets recognized as it is less tangible than beauty standards (mental vs. physical). Today's media often covers stories related to body shaming, unrealistic standards, etc in women, but men's issues (much like suicide) are rarely covered.

Let's start with that. Interested to hear people's opinions :)

As a preface, I'm male and I do think male gender roles can be harmful.

That said sure, men's issues should be covered, but equally? I would argue there would need to be equal damage to necessitate equal coverage. Women are a historically disenfranchised group and if gender norms harm them disproportionately, it would only make sense to cover them more.

Now, of course, the question "who do gender norms harm more?" is pretty much impossible to answer objectively, but I think most people feel that women are harmed more, myself included.

As an aside, this isn't a zero-sum game. Feminism seeks to erode gender norms in general, which would naturally benefit men and women harmed by them. In fact, I'd argue that without feminist movements questioning gender roles for women, there would be nowhere near the level of scrutiny we have for male gender roles.
If you strip away the rhetorical framework that you've chosen to couch your view in it becomes nothing more than "There are some problems that effect men that we should pay attention to". I don't think that anyone could really argue with that.

So the only two problems with your view is that you've chosen to frame it in *opposition* to coverage/concern that women's issues receive and that you believe it's *someone else's* responsibility to call attention to men's issues.

You might not have intended for your view to seem antagonistic towards women's issues, but unfortunately that's how it comes off. You can blame whomever you like for this but 9 times out of 10 (especially on the internet) concern for the social issues that men face are rarely expressed without being accompanied by anti-feminist/women's issues sentiments. Since solving social issues isn't a competition nor a zero sum game, it wouldn't hurt your view in the slightest to do away completely with any thing that smacks of of those very same sentiments. Your ideas will be much more readily heard and accepted, and it will distance you from various Men's rights groups who can't seem to try to solve their pet issues without also denigrating women and their efforts to solve their own issues.

You know where coverage and concern start? With you buddy. If you think that these issues should be covered more, and have more time and attention devoted to them, then do something about it. Do you know why women's issues have been pushed to the forefront? Because the people who cared about that stuff did something about it. 

This statement:

"I'm going to work to alleviate and remedy the social pressures on men."

Reads a lot more sincerely than

"Social pressures on men should be given equal coverage/concern as social pressures on women."

Ironically, do you know who has done a whole shit load of study, activism, and legislation to fix many of these issues? Feminists.
 

I agree with the basic premise of what you're arguing here, but there is a problem with how you seem to be thinking about it.

Yes, it is true that there is a male component of many well-known gender issues, for instance male victims of rape, domestic violence, and body image problems, and also issues that uniquely affect men, like expectations of military service, harsher sentences for the same crimes compared to women, lack of contraceptive options,  circumcision (and yes, I know all about female genital cutting, the difference is that FGM doesn't happen on a vast scale in first-world countries that should know better), and the lack of funding to male-specific cancers despite that they are deadlier than breast and ovarian cancer.  These are real problems, and no serious feminist will tell you otherwise.

But the phrasing here suggests a view that progress is a zero-sum game, that giving attention and awareness to these issues must subtract from attention given to other ones, or that these issues aren't discussed because women's issues have some monopoly on the discussion.  It's not as if there is a finite amount of progress or awareness in the world to go around.  
They should be given equal coverage. Is that all? I think most people can agree to that.

Who is responsible for raising these issues?  FWIW, I've seen a lot of people talk about body image when it comes to men. I regularly see suicide discussed as an issue, though it normally isn't spoken on solely as a men's issue. I think it's easier to bring up issues that women face, because they were historically seen as inferior, and still are seen that way a lot of the time, imo. But it seems that whenever I hear about men's issues, it has something to do with things like being friendzoned, or red pill-type discussions. I guess a better way to phrase that would be that popularly discussed men's issues tend to be framed *against* women, instead of society as a whole. A lot of it seems to be "this particular woman has wronged me" or "this is how women take advantage of men".

In my POV, men's issues are things like lack of help for suicidal people (as you mentioned), parental custody cases, the hyper-masculinization men of color face, the acceptance of trans men, etc. 

I suppose I'm coming at it from my own experiences. I see and hear talk about male issues all the time irl. Male suicide and male education are the big ones. Also I'm male lol.

You have examples of feminists shutting down conversations about male issues, but I see it from the other side as well, males putting down pay disparity or minimising it by saying men do "better" work and so are worth more or something like that.

It's probably ignorant of me but I'm not going to use those sorts of conversations to inform my overall opinions on gender roles because, it's just bickering, or posturing or what ever else. It's always just to put someone down, rather than help a healthy growing discussion to form.

I guess I just don't find the example you gave as one that's different from the others that come from the other side, so they cancel each other out to me. Which is probably me being lazy lol.

The difference is that the stereotypical "male" societal values (e.g. emotional resilience, physical fitness, financial security etc.) are essentially all actually good and healthy attributes to possess.

The problem with the expectations on women isn't that expectations exist, it's that some of those expectations are unhealthy (e.g. focus destructively on weight loss, be submissive and passive etc.)

Equal coverage might not be what you're looking for. Perhaps proportionate coverage. Women are more frequently disenfranchised by societal pressures.

Men's issues can be important: mental health, men's health, body standards, etc. As well as issues relating to gender that affect all parties, mostly paid family leave. This doesn't mean they all appear with equal frequency. However, they do all deserve coverage.
