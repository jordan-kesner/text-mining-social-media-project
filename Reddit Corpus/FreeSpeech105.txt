Title: Social Media Is a Mess. Government Meddling Would Only Make It Worse.

Post:
From a [New York Times opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/14/opinion/supreme-court-social-media.html) (emphasis added):

>This term, the Supreme Court will reconsider America’s laissez-faire approach to regulating the internet, and in doing so it will address vital and new First Amendment questions. Can states stop social media sites from blocking certain content? Can the federal government pressure platforms to remove content it disagrees with?...  
>  
>Despite the unprecedented new societal challenges created by the internet, the court should not back away from its firm stance against most government intervention.  
>  
>In 1997...the court [rejected](https://www.aclu.org/cases/reno-v-aclu-challenge-censorship-provisions-communications-decency-act) the government’s request to narrow the internet’s First Amendment protections as it had done for television and radio broadcasters...\[T\]he court left alone Section 230 of the \[Communications Decency Act\], which immunizes online platforms for liability from user-generated content. Section 230, combined with strong First Amendment protections, left courts and government agencies with little control over platforms’ content decisions.  
>  
>Since then, many on the left and right have questioned that approach, as social media providers and other centralized platforms gain increased power over everyday life. Some conservatives, angry at what they view as politically biased moderation decisions, championed the passage of laws in Florida and Texas that limit platforms’ discretion to block user content.  
>  
>Some liberals, upset that the companies have left up or algorithmically promoted too much constitutionally protected but harmful content such as health misinformation and hate speech, have pressured the companies to become more aggressive moderators...  
>  
>In the other case headed to the Supreme Court, the Fifth Circuit [concluded](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17186623953951244085&q=missouri+v.+biden+fifth+circuit&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&as_ylo=2022) that some efforts by the White House, surgeon general and some federal agencies to encourage social media companies to remove constitutionally protected content, such as alleged Covid misinformation and claims of election fraud, likely violated the First Amendment, finding that officials repeatedly “coerced the platforms into direct action via urgent, uncompromising demands to moderate content"...  
>  
>\[I\]f the Supreme Court gives wide latitude for the government to threaten platforms if they don’t remove constitutionally protected content, such “jawboning” could lead to frequent and indirect government censorship. While the court should allow the government to respond to harmful content — something at which it has not been terribly effective in recent years — it should draw a clear line that prohibits the use of state power to coerce censorship...  
>  
>**\[D\]iluting First Amendment protections would make things worse. As seen in the many countries that have more power to regulate “fake news,” at some point, a judge or elected official will take advantage of power over online speech to suppress dissent or stifle debate...**  
>  
>If...people are concerned about misinformation leading to the spread of authoritarianism, weakening the First Amendment should not be at the top of their agenda...widespread government censorship would not lead to greater trust of institutions.  
>  
>Messy problems arise from speech, and many will continue to exist with or without government intervention. As Justice Stevens [recognized](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/844/), regulation “is more likely to interfere with the free exchange of ideas than to encourage it.” I hope that his successors share this wisdom.

Thanks for printing out a good clip/summary of the article, makes for interesting conversation, actually- but I don't like government overreach, I agree with the writer, government should butt the fuck out. Then again, this leaves us at the mercy of corporations, which isn't much better. I like that reddit gives us a different subs with different levels of moderation. I'm a mod myself, but the way I mod on different subreddits is entirely different. The one I am top mod of has much more of a free-er speech policy- we don't ban on ideology (unless its Zionism, because fuck Israel, but that's new and Idk if I'll keep it) but other subs I mod are much more "safe space" type places. Whatever your ideology, you can probably find a sub on reddit for it- unless its something like race realism of course, because that breaks sitewide rules, but their sitewide rules are not that restrictive, considering. I mean you can't even use the word "decolonize" on Twitter, but there is no one word that is banned on reddit, I mean I approve comments that say the n-word as long as they don't use it in a derogatory way, they reference it or whatever. Usually I prefer that they throw an asterisk in, but neither I, nor reddit, require that.

Having it be at the mercy of corporations is much better assuming there are no monopolies.   Its like new agencies you have multiple ones to choose from all with their ideological bent.  Freedom is in the fact you have multiple choices with different perspectives.

Those who are pushing government control are doing so because they want to remove different perspectives.
