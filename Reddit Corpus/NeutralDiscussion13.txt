Title: What did you do during your free time before the rise of social media, instead of scrolling through social networks?

Read all the time. I read everything: books, newspapers cover-to-cover, at least half a dozen magazines.....I even collected Role Playing Games as a hobby so I could read the rules and source-books even though I probably wouldn't ever play them. Of course, now I possess tons of useless knowledge about tabletop role-playing games from the 80s and 90s no one ever heard of. Like, do you know that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Robotech had roleplaying games using the same ruleset? Like, you could have a mutant squirrel flying around in Veritech Fighters? And in the 90s, thanks to the popularity of Shadowrun, cross genre games were huge. One of the most interesting was a weird little game called Torg.
