Title: Cordcutter PSA: You can watch the Libertarian Party presidential debate online via Playstation Vue

Posting this since I've seen it several times in the comments

If you have a Playstation 4, Playstation 3, Amazon Fire TV, or Amazon Fire TV stick you can sign up for the Free 7 Day trial, which includes Fox Business. 

Also I apologize because I previously said iOS devices could also be used but apparently you need to already own a PS4 or PS3 to use the iOS app. 

Also, you can use your Vue login credentials to use Fox Business' mobile app just like if you had traditional cable. So if you do sign up and know a cordcutter without a compatible device (I'm looking at you Roku and Chromecast), be a friend.

I have a Roku and the worst cable plan. Great internet, though. I'll go through the app.
