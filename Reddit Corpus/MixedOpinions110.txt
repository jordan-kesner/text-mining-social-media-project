Hello everyone, and welcome to the weekly General Discussion thread. Many of you are looking for an informal place (besides [Discord](https://discord.gg/EJ4qAQu)) to discuss non-political topics that would otherwise not be allowed in this community. Well... ask, and ye shall receive.

General Discussion threads will be posted every Friday and stickied for the duration of the weekend. 

Law 0 is suspended. All other community rules still apply. 

As a reminder, the intent of these threads are for \*casual discussion\* with your fellow users so we can bridge the political divide. Comments arguing over individual moderation actions or attacking individual users are \*not\* allowed.

Every year I get real excited and count down the days until football season starts. Every year I turn on the first game, watch 10 minutes, and start doing something else while it's on. Then I repeat that for the next 4 months.

I basically get hyped for my favorite background noise.
Any tennis fans here?  Hoping Big Foe can bring home a major for the Americans, been a while for the men!
Anyone playing interesting video games? My 4-year-old and I have recently gotten into [Grow Up](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/grow-up),  an open-world exploration-focused game from 2016. Basically, you're a robot exploring a totally crazy planet with floating islands, and you grow plants that can do things like rocket into the air or fling you like a catapult. We've also been playing [Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Toad:_Treasure_Tracker)
I've lived in South Jersey all my life, so by default the home teams I root for are all Philadelphia teams. This year, the Eagles seem to have an extremely strong running game, given that their QB can scramble. The problem is QBs that can scramble have the tendency to be one-trick ponies. As a result, while I hope I'm wrong, I'd be surprised if the Eagles made it as far into the post-season as being predicted. The better teams will adapt to a strong running game if the passing game is weak.
For those of you on the fence about Rings of Power: the third episode (imo) is a lot better than the first two.
It happens to me every year, but I still can’t believe it’s almost 9/11 again. Crazy to think about how long it’s been.
