Title: Official Debate Resolution: Socialism is the Answer

Post:
**This is a different post than is usual for our subreddit. There are stricter rules for participating in this debate than is typical and it will be curated.** It has been a while since our last official debate and we have quite a few new faces since then, so it is worth pointing out that **this specific post has rules that are separate from and more strict than our subreddit rules.** Comments that do not follow the rules may be removed, especially top comments. These rules are isolated to this specific post and only this specific post. Please read the rules below and honor them. They are intended to bring a more structured and constructive debate to the subreddit while still allowing anyone to comment. The goal here is more structure and formality to distinguish it from the other more freeform discussions on the subreddit.

If you have ideas for a future debate topic or changes to the format please feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/S7jztb6). There will be a top level META comment for those that want to discuss the post rather than the comment. All other top level comments MUST follow the rules. Eventually I plan on making a wiki for all the old official debates and their polls/results. Perhaps I will edit this post to include it. Until then, you can search the official debates by using the Filter by flair option "Debate".

Top Comments:
Pro: Before I start, socialism as defined in this comment section, does not entail the workers owning the means of production in totality. Socialism entails the people within a society choosing the goals, priorities, and needs for that society. In other words, while people could choose to vote government total control over the means of production, that isn’t a particularly likely outcome and is not one I would support in totality. Rather, people should vote themselves (as a society) equitable access to the necessities of life (Food, Shelter, Water and Clothing).

 

Socialism is an amoral economic system, akin to Capitalism. It is an engine that can be levied for the public good in whole or in part; in other words, the entire economic system can be Socialist or merely parts of it. I would argue for the latter.

 

Capitalism does not prioritize; Capitalism allows those with capital (money, wealth, power/political capital) to rig the game inequitably in their favor; we saw this play out in the gilded age as we are starting to see it again today. Capitalism gives advantage to those people who put self over community; it rewards corruption and greed necessarily as the basis for Capitalistic advantage is people’s desire to get ahead, or be better, or do more than their neighbor. It enhances natural competitive instincts and hones them; more often to negative outcomes in society. The result of this is that anywhere a dollar can be made, a dollar will be made – if I can get away with charging you $10 for a banana that cost me $0.05 to make, I will – and indeed I *should*. Capitalism naturally tends toward monopoly, and give those with capital an unfair advantage in the economy and society at large.

 

Socialism inherently prioritizes; the society at large determines the game rather than those few with Capital. Socialism allows those resources that are necessary to be provided to those the society agrees are most worth receiving them; in other words, that same banana that costs $0.05 to make can be provided at cost to those who need it, given that we agree who that banana should be given to. Socialism allows for equity (NOT equality).

 

Today, under capitalism, if you take two people of equal skill – twins even! – and place them in two different environments growing up you can get vastly different outcomes. Place one in a wealthy, connected home with access to good schools, teachers, college and more with parents who value hard work and dedication, that twin will succeed. Put the other with a single mother, struggling to make ends meet, force them to help raise a house full of kids while working full time and juggling school on top – they’ll never get as far as the wealthy twin – despite having similar ability. This system favors those who lucked in to their position in life, all other things being equal.

 

Under socialism, we the people set the value of labor rather than the market. We the people decide where to allocate resources rather than capital. We the people can provide for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all people, rather than meager existence for some funding the lavish lives of others.

 

Now, I will note – Capitalism is an amazing innovation engine. Inequality drives innovation and change, like heat in thermodynamics nothing moves without that unequal placement of goods. I would not argue for equality – some people deserve more than others based on their contributions to society – but everyone deserves a bare minimum. In fact, everyone requires a bare minimum. You cannot live without Food, Water and Shelter.

 

Unfortunately, under Capitalism – despite extreme abundance, Food, Water and Shelter are made artificially scarce. Why? Because Capital wants a return on their capital (more money). This is, as described above, how Capitalism operates today. However, in the US we have:

30% more food than it would take to feed every person in the US (this is before exports – just food waste on our own markets)

500,000 homeless people (300,000 homeless families) with 1,700,000 homes for sale, on the market, today (and another 11,000,000 unoccupied but not for sale)

Water becoming more and more privatized by the day *cough* Nestle *cough*.

Everyone needs these resources – but Capitalism incentivizes selling them for the absolute most profit possible. It rewards those who are not altruistic, who can use those additional resources to buy out or replace those who are. Is it any surprise the number of farmers shrinks annually, but crop yields continue to increase?

 

So, here’s my ideal system; the people should guarantee, through government, everyone’s needs. The houses exist. The food exists. The water exists. Profit cannot and should not drive those markets that everyone needs access to. Capitalism was fantastic at innovating and reducing prices for these goods, but abundance is here – it’s time to share the rewards. If you want more than those basics, that’s where Capitalism holds. Over time, that space becomes smaller and smaller. As we figure out perfect or near-perfect solutions to old problems, like Nuclear Fusion for energy or end-to-end automation for household appliances, we should socialize those markets too; but they are not the priority that needs (Food, Water, Shelter) are.

 

Now; someone out there might say – safety net covers this! – to that person I say, no, our safety net requires you work in almost every state and federally for many programs. We do not need everyone who is already working to work (I can point to articles on BS jobs if it helps). We are tied to this system because Capitalism demands it, not because it is efficient or works best.
**Con:** Socialism works in smaller communes, when you know Uncle Jimmy has a bad hip and therefore can't contribute as much as Uncle Frank. It falls apart the larger the community gets, as there's no inherent desire for a black obese male in Alabama to support the HIV medication for a young lesbian in California, or the young lesbian to pay for the triple-bypass surgery for the black obese male.

Therefore the only way socialism works at a grand scale is if the government forces these two people to support each other. That leads to an authoritarian government. Which leads to Communism. Which leads to corruption. Which leads to a country failing.

Every attempt at socialism has failed, and we have a corresponding capitalist split test to show just how much it failed:

- PRC versus ROC

- East Germany versus West Germany

- North Korea versus South Korea

- USSR versus USA

- Cuba versus Puerto Rico

Which country would you rather have lived in?
Con

I am going to use the standard definition. Socialism is when the collective whole owns the means of production. 

I am against socialism for a few different reasons. It opposes human freedom which in America we especially value. The right so succeed/fail on your own, the right to be whoever you want to be, etc. It eliminates the individual and values the collective whole.

Humans are naturally competitive. There will always be a sizable portion of the population that wants more. They are the ones who create Microsoft, Amazon, etc. With socialism these companies would never have been created. You can not eliminate the incentive to create new businesses/pursue new ideas and expect the economy not to slow down. 

Lets take a look at some socialist countries. Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, etc. Why would we try to emulate these countries when capitalism has created the richest nation in the world? Does that mean capitalism is perfect? No, of course not. We should be trying to fix the deficiencies within capitalism instead of turning towards an economic system that never turns out well.

**Con:** So, ignoring the myriad issues of socialist systems (and I mean *actual* socialism as defined by Marx, not the meme-socialism that seems to have taken off in the US); the fundamental issue with socialism is the problem of hierarchy and class structures, and as a result the fact that socialist structures are, almost universally, hypocritical.

One of the deeply-rooted fundamental aspects of socialism is the rejection of the idea of class, and as a result the abolition of class structures from society. However, this runs into two major issues; first, that humans (being a social species) have an innate tendency to establish class systems, almost on instinct. The second, however, is the bigger issue; human societies tend to run *better* with class systems, entirely because decisions cannot be made by massed consensus, particularly when those decisions are time-sensitive.

Executive power stops working when spread among too many individuals, and a lack of executive power creates weakness; see the failure of the Spanish Anarchists, who actually succeeded in abolishing their class structures, only to fall to the Fascists in major part because of a lack of actual leadership. As a more recent example, see the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter movements, which haven't really achieved much of substance despite their massed appeal, entirely because both movements, while not explicitly socialist in nature, rejected the idea of centralized leadership that could speak and coordinate on behalf of the rest of the movement.

Thus, for essentially every socialist system with real staying power, the class system hasn't been abolished per-se; instead, the socialist states have always created a *new* hierarchy after establishing themselves and destroying the old hierarchy, entirely to actually focus on the problem of governing. At this point, corruption inevitably infests the new hierarchy, leading to either prolonged slow-burning poverty (e.g. Cuba) or boom-and-bust cycles that threaten to rip the state apart (e.g. Venezuela). Socialists always argue the technicality that the failed examples are all examples of "state capitalism" and not socialism, but while they're perhaps *technically* correct, if every socialist system inevitably becomes a state-capitalist state then what's the point in differentiating?

More troubling are the states with stronger socialist hierarchies and autocratic systems, particularly the USSR and China. In both these examples, the states ended up emphasizing the importance of ethnic identity, and the eradication of vaguely-defined "enemies" both internal and external to the state. In addition, if power is consolidated into a single person (e.g. Stalin, Mao, Xi), then a Cult of Personality forms, further exacerbating the hypocrisy of class structures; the hierarchy becomes an entirely *new* set of social classes, where one's social status and value to society is tied directly to your proximity both to the Party, to the State, and to the Leader. But at this point, the socialist state is no longer discernible from a *fascist* state, where a person's social standing is *also* tied directly to their proximity to the State and Leader. Hence why it should come as no surprise that it can be hard to tell the difference between Communist and Fascist ideologies.

In any case, the problem of class hierarchies is what fundamentally dooms all socialist states; either they stay true to the goals of socialism and reject all forms of class and hierarchy and fall to victimization by stronger external rivals from a lack of leadership, or they accept the necessity for hypocrisy only to risk either a quick fall into corruption and disrepair, or a deeper dive into ethno-nationalism and autocracy.

Now this isn't to say that socialist ideas are completely useless; Marx's criticisms of liberalism in *Das Kapital* are quite valid, and he does highlight many potential weaknesses and shortcomings within a liberal-capitalist society that must be continually monitored and counteracted. But Marx being a good diagnostician doesn't mean his prescription is good or workable, and as the record plainly shows, socialism just doesn't work.
Pro:

I'm going to take this a bit differently than most, because I think the *way* in which we are discussing Socialism as the Answer is inhibitive.  Instead of offering pure systemic socialism as the answer, I wish to argue in favor of Socialism being the Answer directionally.    
That is, I believe that adopting more socialist principles in this country will better serve its people than would remaining where we are or abolishing currently existing socialist structures.

Socialism: policies implemented based on the political and economic theory that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.

There are several areas of society that are easily better (for the people of this country)  to manage without such an uninhibited profit motive.

  
**Military:** While for profit militarism can be great for a subset of people in a country, it will disproportionately kill the poor of that country and any country that military sets its sights on.  
We've not fully abandoned this mode of militarism, but we've certainly moved some distance away from the East India Company model of military. The Military-Industrial-Congressional complex is an area where we should move to avoid profit motives and instead rely on a more communal regulation.  Likewise, the encroachment of the Executive on the more democratic body's decision making regarding military action should be rolled back.  While we likely can't manage the military in a fully democratic way (community managed)  we should make sure that the people who do manage it are close enough to the people that would be put in harms way so as to be less willing to engage in military action so that Raytheon can sell more missiles.  


**Education:**  Education is too important to limit by personal funding.   We understand this with k-12, but we see fit to run an increasingly expensive lending operation on the backs of our future innovators, job creators, and talent.  Education should be decoupled or at least insulated from profit-motive systems that artificially reduce the number of people who apply for and receive higher education and job training opportunities.

**Healthcare:**  Like education, healthcare is a vital piece of our shared civilization. We currently have so many divisions in sources of *coverage* for care & then a gotcha option in out of network care.  These not only costs us overhead in keeping track of these networks, billing for services and collections activities, but also limits people's options for seeking affordable (non-cost-prohibitive) care.  A profit-driven system will see no difference between providing care for 1, 2, or 10 people. Measures that increase billed costs are as good or better than caring for more people.  
Systems like these require us to at the very least curb the profit motive. I believe fully shared ownership of these systems to be the best model to do that, but almost anything that moves towards a socialized system would be an improvement:  where we can utilize a shared concern for health outcomes coupled with democratic controls rather than controls from key industry players who, again on their own will see no difference between providing 100% of care needed for $X profit and providing 85% of the care needed for the same $X in profit.  
Socialized Healthcare need not be a full seizing of all production, distribution, or exchange either.  Merely a collective (rather than private) ownership and regulation of the risk pool itself is a move towards Socialism, rather than privitization.

**Incarceration:**  Privatized profit-driven prisons are another area that is detrimental to society. We don't want to generate demand for prisons, but we have done exactly that with things like drug enforcement policy and for-profit prisons. On a moral level, we shouldn't entrust private entities with individuals charged to state care in order to keep the rest of society safe, but beyond that with a system that benefits from recidivism, has a captive market to price gouge and impoverish, and is interested in expanding the scope of crimes for which it can accept new sources of revenue,  we should move to socialize the prison system-  society must collectively own and manage this system to ensure we are utilizing it appropriately.  Privatized for profit management is a failure here.  


Directionally, I believe all of these systems, and several others could use more Socialism, rather than more privitization (or no change.)  I see arguments about authoritarian governments attempting to achieve communism and the results of that pursuit as a distraction from or distortion of actual policies that should be implemented with the aim to better serve the people of this country directly, rather than relying on profit motive to somehow create a better result.

&#x200B;

I'd be happy to discuss any of the above topics, and would additionally be interested in any other systems that would be presented as counter points where **more** privatization is a better answer than the current system.
Con

First, a definition. Socialism is government-mandated collective ownership of the means of production. Voluntary profit-sharing or collective operation is not socialism. Wealth redistribution through taxation is not socialism (though the line begins to blur at increasing levels of taxation). Government-seizure of the means of production is communism.

Social distribution of the fruits of labor can and has worked for some societies, particularly smaller tribes that voluntarily share their resources. This works because the members of the community have direct, personal social ties to each other and a sense of accountability to each other. Members of society who do not contribute in some way do not go unnoticed and consequences become possible, if not inevitable. Members of the society who recognize this have the ability to withdraw their contributions and/or exclude the offending members.

When you bring government into the mix you are obligated to share your resources under the threat of force. Additionally, you are forced to share your resources with individuals you do not know and cannot vet. There is little to no recourse for members who do not contribute, and the historical result has been mass inefficiency as it becomes possible to benefit from the system without contributing. There has never been a successful implementation of socialism at the nation-state level which worked better than capitalistic alternatives, and human nature would suggest that it is not likely to be possible.
con - socialism is successful if everyone working for the good of everyone else

while some people are that altruistic you cannot rely on it.

the problems we see in socialist societies are in part, i think, to the group in power gaming the system to get more than what they are due

capitalist societies don't have that problem.  everyone is essentially working for themselves.  the problem with that is when people who have more money can buy legislation at the expense of those who have less
