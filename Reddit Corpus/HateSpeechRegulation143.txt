Title: I'm looking for a social media analytics tool that lets me track all the platform's metrics and data in a single place.

Post:
We are a brand and we post content on Instagram, Youtube and Tiktok. I'm looking for a tool that lets me visualize all the data at one single platform. Please point me towards any good tools that you have come across. Thanks in advance. 

I'm already exploring Hootsuite, Shortimize, etc let me know if you know any better tools.
