Title: 2024 r/ModeratePolitics Subreddit Demographics Survey

Post:
It's been [2 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/v62tyg/2022_rmoderatepolitics_subreddit_demographics/) since our last Subreddit Demographics Survey, and with a major election on the horizon, we're overdue for another one.

**What is the demographics survey?**

It's our way of getting a pulse on the community's background and political leanings in a more structured manner. It also allows the Mod Team to gather feedback on any changes you'd like to see in how this community is run.

**What kind of questions will I be asked?**

We have 3 main sections: core user demographics, political labels/leanings, and subreddit feedback. We also typically add in a handful of political policy sections. Last year was gun control and abortion. This year is foreign policy and education.

**How long will this take?**

Depending on which questions you wish to answer (they're all optional), it should take no more than 5-10 minutes.

**Can we see the results?**

Yes! As we have [done in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/vgl5sw/results_2022_rmoderatepolitics_subreddit/), once the survey is closed, we will release the summary results for all to see. We typically keep the survey up for at least 2 weeks, so expect results sometime in early August.

**Why do I need to provide a Google account?**

Google requires an account to ensure users only respond once to the survey. But don't worry; Google does not send this information to us. We only see your form responses.

If you have any questions, or if we messed something up, feel free to comment below. Now without further ado...

For the occupation question, I felt it was a little confusing to pick something for people in the manufacturing industry.
Some if the direct policy questions, it felt like the answers were a bit too black and white.

Specifically on

Education - I don't think many people disagree that teachers should be paid more, or that children deserve to eat a meal at school regardless of their parents economic status. The concern I've personally seen in conservative circles is more that the money does not filter down to those areas. Things like meals taxes are not showing to provide any noticeable improvement in education quality, and some of the worst performing school systems drastically outspend their peers on a per student basis. Many conservatives view school boards and executive bloat as the problem, not necessarily the teachers themselves (though I will admit I had some AWFUL teachers growing up who even as a kid I could tell they were lazy and wanted an easy job with a 3 month summer vacation)

Ukraine - A bit of nuance here would probably have been more helpful. There is a difference between "sending mothballed equipment" and "sending direct cash". A fair amount of the opposition I've seen has been to direct cash (used for propping up government salaries and funding the day to day operations). In the end, I ended up saying "stay the same amount" but would have preferred "continue to send outdated military hardware but no direct cash"
Man I love answering a good 'ol survey. 

Was unfamiliar with a few of the candidate options in some of the questions.  Need to do my research, as they say.
2022 survey had 50% answer they voted for Biden and only 17% that they voted for Trump. Would like to see what a post 2024 election survey looks like.
That candidate list really highlights just how old so many of our options are. I won't lie, age negatively affected several of the options for me.
I get this is mostly a sub with US topics, but some of these questions felt weird answering as a non-US citizen lol
I already did the survey but I just thought it would be interesting to include a question like "have you been sanctioned by mods and if so how many times" to see how many people here have been hit with moderation lol
It would be helpful if this survey allowed for more nuanced responses - questions with 2 choices without an option to provide a short response/other contributes to bias.
It's weird answering 'urban' living in a small seacoast region town in NH of ~15k people but according to census data the part of Exeter I live in is considered an 'urban cluster', with everything else within city limits being 'rural'. I honestly had no idea how to answer that question correctly until I did some research.
The political leanings area could use some more options if possible.  I thought it was missing Ayn Rand fan / Objectivist.
