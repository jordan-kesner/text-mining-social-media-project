Title: Adult Social Media Ads & Community Building Help

Post:
I’m building multiple Reddit accounts to promote my NSFW, no-taboo AI chat site, cross-posting daily, and gaining 50-250 new followers per day. The conversion rate on Reddit is solid, and I only post in relevant subreddits.

On other platforms, like X, I’ve found it much harder to build a community—my content gets pushed down, reaches fewer users, and overall engagement is low. Reddit, on the other hand, is much more effective for reaching an audience.

Can anyone suggest other social media platforms similar to Reddit, where community building and reach are good?

All platforms have community guidelines, which you would breach with the content. You'd have to market it as far more mild spicy to get any traction, so your better bet is to try and run ads on the other platforms, and push the ad format as far as you can until they get rejected, then you know you've hit the limit of the content rules. But don't do this with your own ad account you'll need to find someone to run the ads for you. Post on reddit to find one.
