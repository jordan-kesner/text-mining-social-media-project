Title: What essential questions should you ask to improve your content through feedback?

Post:
I usually create content based on my instincts or what I assume my followers are looking for, but I'm not always confident in my choices.

I want to put together a set of basic questions that I can use to get feedback from my team before we finalize and publish anything. These questions would act as a quick check to help us identify areas for improvement and ensure our content performs better.

Here are a few questions Iâ€™m considering:

* **Would you share this video with others?** (Yes, No, Maybe)
* **Was the video length appropriate?** (Just Right, Too Long, Too Short)
* **Did the video hold your attention?** (Completely, Mostly, Partially, Not at all)

If you have any other questions that you think could help enhance our content across different topics, I'd love to hear them! The idea is to create general questions that can be applied to any type of content.

This is a fantastic approach to refining your content! Your proposed questions are a great starting point for gathering valuable feedback. To add to your list, consider these additional questions that might further enhance your content:



- Did the video include valuable information or insights? 

- How likely are you to engage with this content again?



These additional questions could help you further refine and enhance your content by focusing on clarity, value, and overall engagement. Feel free to adjust them based on your specific needs. Looking forward to seeing how these insights help you create even better content!
These questions are good! But I'd also try to ask questions that maybe feel more personalized? People love talking about themselves. So maybe something like, **"Why did you click on this video?"** / **"What made you watch this?"** / **"What stood out for you in this video?"** if that makes sense? 

User research is also very important - primary research, like asking your audience, is obviously just as (if not more) important, but don't shrug off secondary research. Look at what's grabbing the attention of your target audience, what else they are engaging with, etc. 

Goodluck! :)
Thanks for the feedback!!!

this are some of the questions i have gather so far:

\*\*How easy was it to understand the video's content?\*\* Very Easy, Easy, A Bit Confusing, Very Confusing

\*\*Did you feel the video was too promotional?\*\* Yes, No, A Little Bit

\*\*Was the call to action (if any) clear and compelling?\*\* Very Clear and Compelling, Clear, Somewhat Clear, Not Clear

\*\*Would you engage with this video (like, comment, share)?\*\* Definitely, Probably, Maybe, No

\*\*Does the video catch your attention within the first few seconds?\*\* Yes, No, Somewhat

Ill be adding the ones that we get here and then put them all toghether :D
indeed! i will try then a mix of multiple choice and written personalized questions :D i think i can make this into an app... would you be interested in something like this? i think it would be of great help for many creators that feel alone in the process and it may take years for some to understand what works and what doens't :)
