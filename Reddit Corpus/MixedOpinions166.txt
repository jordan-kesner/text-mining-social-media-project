Title: CMV: We should start saying "majority privilege" instead of "white privilege" because it'd be a much more effective term

Post:
For the purposes of this discussion, I'm just going to assume that we all agree that privilege exists in the first place - I'm not too interested in debating that.

Basically, I think it's important for white people in the USA to understand the concept of privilege and racism - but I'm not sure that "white privilege" is the best term when describing it to them.

As a white person I first felt angry and annoyed when talking about "white privilege" - I felt personally attacked, or that I was being criticized for some innate quality I could not change about myself.  Unfortunately I think this delayed my full understanding of this concept a little bit since I'd often become defensive whenever the term was used in conversation or debate - and its well documented in studies that being defensive literally limits your understanding, you become more rigid in your beliefs and you begin to enter survivalist thinking (fight or flight).

I'm now a full believer in white privilege and I'm trying to understand and listen to other's experiences, but it frustrates me that this conversation tends to often turn people off exactly when it should be reaching out to them.

For that first reason (and more) I believe "majority privilege" would be a far more effective term when talking about the privilege we experience (without diluting who the majority is)...it would also be a much more flexible term that could help explain other "majority privileges" (say between straight vs. gay, etc).

"Majority privilege" also better define the power dynamics the term is seeking to explore - because the actual power structure actually has nothing to do with skin color (well, obviously it does but let me explain).  Yes, this *current* power structure we reference as white privilege is about skin color but skin color is the defining variable, not the prime motivator - white skin in and of itself does not create privilege or power absent of demographics, history, population, and tribalism.

There's already a backlash among people who believe they aren't racist that grow furious when told they have "white privilege" - I'd suggest that this is first and foremost because they feel under attack by the term "white privilege" and that they'd be far more open to understanding their privilege as the **majority** demographic in this country...this removes blame over something the person can't control (their skin color) and instead moves their attention to the power structure itself.

Maybe you'd like to argue that white feelings are not that important, and it's their fault if they aren't listening to minorities about the privileges they experience.  Maybe, but I always think it's important - no matter how frustrating - to consider the best way to reach an audience, even if you don't think they deserve any kindness.  "Majority privilege" would certainly be a less divisive term.  Is there any reason to believe that if our roles were completely reversed, and the country was 70% black or Latino or Asian, I'd argue that the same frustrations, micro aggressions, and systemic pressure would exist in favor of the new majority group...so again, "majority privilege" keeps the conversation focused on the important defining principle in the power structure - majority - which you can still connect to race obviously but you're audience will be more open.

I think that's it.  I'll maybe update this if I think of anything else.

EDIT:  âˆ† I didn't think this through very well.  Mind changed very quickly.

I think a big part of the problem with people's easy acceptance of white privilege is that it's seldom accompanied by any discussion of class privilege. We have this whole intersectional complex of privilege, but probably the *biggest* form of privilege seems to get the least attention. A good chunk of the time when white people are annoyed at being called privileged, it's because in terms of class, they *aren't*. 
    
A poor ass white kid is not privileged in comparison to Will Smith's kids. They may not encounter racism where Will Smith's kids might, but they don't have a big pile of money and a famous dad to take care of them and help them overcome obstacles in life. Major obstacles for people in poverty often aren't on the radar of even middle-class people. There's not any other single factor that's so experience-defining as access to wealth. 
  
Introducing the subject of privilege in a way that makes the person you're talking to feel like you're saying they have it easy is always going to be less effective than introducing it in a way that recognizes privilege they *lack*. It's much easier to see something someone else has that you don't than to consider something you take for granted. That people take their privilege for granted is the issue to begin with, wouldn't you say? 
  
So if you've got someone who *isn't* reaping the benefits of extreme class privilege, you've already got something you can communicate the idea to them easily with. From there, it's just a matter of pointing out that there are *a lot* of things like that, and we don't tend to notice the ones that don't apply to us negatively. 
  
And along /u/darwin2500's line of thought, extreme class privilege is by no means in the majority. Lack of overt poverty, certainly, but economic inequality is massive across the board, not just toward the bottom. 
 
A bit late to the party, but I think the problem, more than labeling it as "white" or "male" lays in the word "privilege". 

Because, as you have seen in several comments here, don't feel privileged. They notice their disadvantages and that's how they frame the conversation. 

Then you have to explain thet "privilege" means the disadvantages they don't have to face because of their race and then the discussion becomes one about semantics instead of social justice. 

Also, talking about privilege keeps the dicussion focused on the groups that are advantaged. 

So, I think instead of talking about "white privilege" it would be more effective to talk about "black disadvantage". That way you would be able to frame a conversation in terms that people would be more willing to see and imagine, and also would be really talking about the people you want to talk about. 

The word privilege makes people feel attacked because it kinda implies they're responsible for the problem. With a word like "disadvantage" you could frame the issue to make them feel like they're part of the solution. 

(Also, I think it would be very important to remember that intersectionality also applies to white people. They can be outside certain structures of privilege and that can be even more determining than their race. But again, that's part of a different coonversation)
Apartheid.

The privileged group isn't always in the majority.

Also, the majority of people in the US are women, I still have male privilege at my CS job.
In short, it's because it's not as simple as being the majority.

White privilege, and social theory built around the idea of white privilege, relates heavily to white colonialism and the historical context of western society. Racial segregation, slavery, exploitation, oppression, all are real events that happened that shouldn't be ignored when explaining something in society. 

We couldn't call it majority privilege because that would be ignoring the context, which relates specifically to the acts that white groups have done in the past. This context helps to explain WHY white privilege exists, so it's quite important.

There's no need to be annoyed or offended by it. I'm white too, and it's important to realise that it's not an actual criticism of you as a person at all. It's simply a description of the fact that if you're white society gives you certain advantages as a byproduct of that. That's just a fact. But it's not your fault and nobody except some very misguided people on the internet (please don't make the mistake of thinking that they represent the actual social theory behind it) would ask you to apologise for the way you were born. 
I'm sympathetic to the sentiment, and maybe it would make it easier for some people, but We're not going to make substantive progress on race relations if using the words white and black make people too uncomfortable to have a conversation. White privilege as a term foregrounds whiteness on purpose. Most white people go through their day barely if ever reflecting upon how their whiteness is effecting all of their millions of tiny interactions and transactions within power structures and social networks. Whiteness becomes transparent, a default, a given. Using the words White Privilege at once makes whiteness visible and makes it unusual, as a privilege bestows more than what is usual. 

I do like however the idea of using Majority Privilege as a catch all term... way more catchy and useful than something ridiculous like ableist europhallocentric heteronormativity. A political philosopher (Deleuze) I like uses the words majoritarian and minortarian to describe the interplay of power very articulately.
I disagree. I feel like instead of calling it "privilege" we need to be calling others "disadvantaged". The so called privilege that whites go through is not a privilege, it should be normal experiences. However what blacks and other poc go through should be thought of as not up to par worth what are normal encounters. Just my thoughts on the matter. Tell me what you think :)

Unfortunately, you can't avoid having the discussion about whether privilege exists and what it means. Without that, you are effectively arguing about facts about unicorns, for example. If we just assume unicorns exist, then any answer we get is ultimately meaningless.

I am not at all suggesting that privilege doesn't exist either. But I do think we need to be *exactly* clear on what we mean by it, how one can demonstrate it exists, and can demonstrate who does or doesn't have it.

Some definitions of privilege are very easy to prove and to measure. Individual privilege gained by wealth, fame, positions of authority, etc., are relatively easy to measure. *Collective* privilege is either (a) impossible to demonstrate, or (b) misused.

Let's suppose, for example, you take some metric that represents a privilege that you want to measure, and you check the value of that metric across a wide population of people, then sort the data by some measured trait such as identified race. If you show that *all* people of Population 1 are higher than *all* people of the Population 2, then you might have an argument about "Population 1 privilege".

There is still a problem with that, of course, because part of the definition of "privilege" is "something unearned" or "undeserved". A correlation of trait with an different outcome for all members isn't enough. You need a causal relationship. For example, if you measure privilege is by measuring the number of telephones and your two populations are, say, atheists vs Amish, and you note that all of the atheists have telephones and none of the Amish do, would it be fair to say the atheists are "privileged" when it comes to telephones? If you did, it would render the meaning of "privilege" to something quite different, because the reason for the difference is because the Amish made their own self ban on telephones back around 1910. The difference wouldn't be due to a "privilege" of atheists but would due to a rejection by the Amish of their own choice. 

Hence even if you have *all* members of one population rating higher on some measurement scale over *all* members of another population, that alone is not enough to infer "privilege". It's the standard point that correlation is not causation. You need to investigate causal relationships.

Another possible outcome of comparing the two populations is that one is *statistically* higher than the other. Take, for example, the height of men and women. The average height of men is about 5" taller than the average height of women. Could one then call men "height privileged". Well, it *is* unearned, but there's a problem.

What does it mean to tell a 5' tall man that he is "height privileged" and a 6' tall woman that she is a "height victim"? It's not only meaningless, it is a moral injustice to do that. Clearly the 5' man is shorter than the 6' woman. The *average* is a feature of the *group as a whole* and does not apply to individual members. Applying it that way is the [fallacy of division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_division). Individuals are not the average. Supposing there is some value in being tall, a short man doesn't get that value and a tall woman does. Thus criticizing and complaining about the "height privilege" of the short man is immorally kicking a person when they are down. His height wasn't his choice, he is short, and he is accused of having the privilege of being tall when he clearly isn't. And the 6' woman is similarly given false sympathy for being a short height victim when she is tall. You can't use *averages* to describe something as being true of *all* members. If your metric of height privilege is "somebody above 6 feet tall", then the correct application is to measure each individual's height and accuse those above 6' as being privileged -- whether man or woman. Using gender is an unnecessary variable that is imperfectly correlated, and used for no good reason. If height matters, then measure height.

Another set of problems with the concept of privilege is identifying exactly what measures get included or not, and how to weight them. If you measure Population 1 as being higher than Population 2 on one metric, but Population 2 as being higher than Population 1 on another, what does that mean for an *overall* "privilege"?

So that takes us to how you, and others, use *privilege*. I've heard the term hundreds of times but every time I ask for a definition I get attacked and some form of being told to shut up. Nobody has yet defined it in a way that means any reasonable answer.

In some cases people refer to, for example, the statistical difference between whites and blacks as far as being stopped by police. But that's a *statistical* difference, like the height difference above. The curves overlap. There are plenty of white individuals who have been stopped or harassed many times and blacks who have been stopped or harassed few times, or never. It might be a difference of outcomes by race, but you cannot apply differences in averages to that of individuals.

I hear similar things about whites with respect to power or wealth, saying that most of the people with power or wealth or white, and therefore whites have the power and wealth, and are therefore privileged. But again, that's bad statistical reasoning that doesn't apply to all individuals of either population. That's specifically a [base rate fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy). That people with wealth and power tend to be white doesn't mean that white people tend to have wealth or power. Crows tend to be birds (100% are) does not mean birds tend to be crows (<<1% are). Most white people have no more wealth or power than most black people. A very tiny percentage of white people have wealth and power, as does a tiny percentage of black people, or other races. Those with wealth and power are at the top tail of the distribution, so even very tiny differences in average or standard deviation will have big effects on the tails. That's the nature of statistical distributions, but you most certainly can not generalize to even the whole population, and certainly not to individuals. For example, in [this figure](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/normaldistributionandsamplingdistribution-110919094400-phpapp01/95/normal-distribution-and-sampling-distribution-11-728.jpg?cb=1316425663), Population B is clearly much lower than Population A on average and the bulk is lower. But, if you only look at the top of this "society", say above a value of 18 on the x-axis, you'll note that it is dominated by members of Population B.

This could, for example, represents the status in life for men vs women. If >18 means CEOs, politicians, elite professors, top earners, wealth, etc., then men (B) occupy most of the top compared to women (A). But, that represents only very few men and women. The average man might even be worse off as is the average of women, such as deaths and injury at work, homelessness, substance abuse, prison, victims of violence, family taken away, killed in war, etc. You can't make broad conclusions by looking at the top tail only, yet that's what a lot of people do when it comes to "privilege". That is a problem.

Or the issue of what metrics count. Clearly there are things in society you can measure where whites or males are higher *on average* by proportion, but there are other metrics where women or minorities are higher by proportion, such as affirmative action elements. Getting a scholarship is much easier for women or a minority. Getting a job as police officer or firefighter is easier, proportionally speaking, for women and minorities. (If privileges are by individual metrics, are these "minority privilege" or "women's privilege"?) These don't nullify the ones where whites are statistically higher, but you can't cherry pick *only* the metrics where whites or males score higher. You need to look across all aspects of life for individuals in society for trade offs. 

And then of course comes the definition of privilege that includes an "unearned" element. When you see things statistically different, that doesn't mean unearned. Think back to the phones of the atheists and Amish. Different outcomes doens't mean privilege.

So we are knee-deep in a bunch of fallacies when we start talking about "privilege". It is ill-defined, poorly argued, and rarely given any sort of means of checking. People just claim it and cherry pick whichever dataset they think proves their point.

So I continue to challenge that "privilege" exists at the collectively level in any legitimate sense. I think people use it to rationalize their own racist or sexist views, and sadly the result of such use it to increase racism and sexism in society, not reduce it, thanks to our innate [ingroup/outgroup tribalism](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201012/in-groups-out-groups-and-the-psychology-crowds), as modeled by [Realistic Conflict Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realistic_conflict_theory). I find the concept intellectually abhorrent, divisive, filled with hate, harming the very people it claims to want to help, and is used by [demagogues](https://www.google.ca/search?q=demagogue&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=m0_ZWKf0N-HejwSl24nICg) to earn points off the back of the harms and injustice these concepts create.
Majority privilege may be less emotionally charged, and arguably inaccurate, but it doesn't explain the phenomenon more effectively. 

Describing how it came to be, with names like:

- institutional advantage
- historic right
- exclusive leadership structures
- opportunity bias

move the emphasis to why the problem exists at all rather than to who experiences it.
Surely tribal privilege would make more sense than majority privilege, wouldn't it?

After all, what we're talking about, generally speaking, is current and historical tribal favoritism towards its members and the disadvantages offered to those outside the tribe. This isn't really a majority thing or a white thing - everyone has privilege.

At the end of the day though, the term "white privilege" is still useful since it is simply describing the privilege of one particular tribe and in the context of America, we should recognize the effect and magnitude of privilege given to its members and disadvantages to non-members.

Of course, we should also recognize that a person can be a member of multiple tribes (e.g. the female tribe, white tribe and the rich tribe) with a corresponding complex mixture of privilege and disadvantages. This part of the discussion is usually lacking when talking about privilege and I believe it leads a lot of people, particularly disadvantaged white men, to become defense and hostile toward the concept.

When talking about privilege though, we're talking about averages and painting with an extremely broad brush. We're ignoring the other tribes one belongs to as well as the magnitude of disadvantages faced from tribes one isn't a member of  and most importantly, we're completely ignoring personal experience. Trying to compare two individuals' actual experienced privilege based on such broad concepts as "white privilege"  is an exercise in sophistry. However, privilege, as a concept, is useful to talk about when we're looking at society as a whole.
