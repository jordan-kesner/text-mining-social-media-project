Title: The Supreme Court is deciding whether to hear Laura Loomer’s Big Tech censorship case

Post:
 The US Supreme Court is [deliberating](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/DocketFiles/html/Public/20-969.html) whether to hear its first case where Big Tech is accused of implementing political bias and censorship. 

 The lawsuit against Google, Apple, Facebook and Twitter was first filed by Laura Loomer and Freedom Watch in 2018, citing discrimination of conservatives in violation of the US Constitution’s First Amendment. 

\[...\]

 According to the filing, the plaintiffs accuse the four large and influential tech companies of violating the First Amendment in a documented, public, and anti-competitive manner aimed at suppressing conservative content. 

The [amended complaint](https://reclaimthenet.org/laura-loomer-petitions-the-supreme-court/) the Supreme Court is now considering cites, among other things, statements made by former Big Tech employees that support the notion that the censorship campaign is real and politically and ideologically targeted – something described as a conspiracy to suppress conservative content and prevent conservative advocates and candidates from raising funds.

Several high profile cases of demonetizations and bans are mentioned, such as that of Prager University and Western Journal on YouTube, and the across the board deplatforming of Alex Jones.

Idk about this. I think these companies should be able to censor whoever they want. But they also should be stripped of any public money that’s ever assisted them in getting their monopolies up until this point and going forward. Maybe this lawsuit is a way to make them pay up and think again for pulling this crap...

But it also makes we leery that politicians (either campaigning or in office) will have extra protection (from being censored by social media companies) that regular people won’t have.

Ultimately I would want to prevent private social media companies from advertising any political materials, period.

Anything that suppresses conservative content and prevents conservative advocates and candidates from raising funds is something I support.  I hate that wrong shit.
Doubt she will win. This looks like it is being tried as a First Amendment case. They would have to show the named parties are state actors for that.
Government (federal and local) could certainly make such requirements for money they offer.

I don't think she will win this one though. The named parties are not state actors.
Good points. I would also be in favor of social media companies advertising any political material. That’s an excellent, helpful idea.
>From memory, similar arguments were made about company towns (upheld)

PragerU tried that against YouTube. The courts take an extremely narrow interpretation of the company owned town ruling. It did not work for PragerU. Someone had tried that with a Sony online community too. In both cases, these non-government companies have not been found to be state actors and thus are not constrained by the First Amendment.

I don't think that there is a clear criteria for "political speech" beyond speech about representatives and elections.  Outside of that, whatever is considered political changes over time and from person to person. When Captain Kirk and Uhura kissed on Star Trek, that was co sided political by some. Not so much today. When the character Murphy Brown decided to have a baby without being married or having a man, that was considered a political statement by some at the time it happenes.
More recently there was also the ruling stating that Trump's Twitter page was a public forum (barring him from blocking people). Which begs the question, why have corporations been allowed to restrict the speech of/to public officials?
