Title: CMV: Conservatives do not, in fact, support "free speech" any more than liberals do.

Post:
In the past few years (or decades,) conservatives have often touted themselves as the party of free speech, portraying liberals as the party of political correctness, the side that does cancel-culture, the side that cannot tolerate facts that offend their feelings, liberal college administrations penalizing conservative faculty and students, etc.

Now, as a somewhat libertarian-person, I definitely see progressives being indeed guilty of that behavior as accused. Leftists aren't exactly accommodating of free expression. The problem is, I don't see conservatives being any better either.

Conservatives have been the ones banning books from libraries. We all know conservative parents (especially religious ones) who cannot tolerate their kids having different opinions. Conservative subs on Reddit are just as prone to banning someone for having opposing views as liberal ones.  Conservatives were the ones who got outraged about athletes kneeling during the national anthem, as if that gesture weren't quintessential free speech. When Elon Musk took over Twitter, he promptly banned many users who disagreed with him. Conservatives have been trying to pass "don't say gay" and "stop woke" legislation in Florida and elsewhere (and also anti-BDS legislation in Texas to penalize those who oppose Israel). For every anecdote about a liberal teacher giving a conservative student a bad grade for being conservative, you can find an equal example on the reverse side. Trump supporters are hardly tolerant of anti-Trump opinions in their midst.

Donald Trump literally tweeted that he would look into ending tax cuts for the NFL if they didn't suppress the free speech of their employees.  This became a battle cry for the conservatives.

"Free Speech" is about the government surpressing protected speech, not some made up right to have someone else platform your bullshit.
A quick google search has some statistics. Obviously not definitive cause it's only 1 survey, but I think it generally aligns with what I've experienced: [https://drt.cmc.edu/2023/09/25/survey-on-free-speech/](https://drt.cmc.edu/2023/09/25/survey-on-free-speech/)

"Poll respondents were read this statement: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” Only 31% of Democratic voters “strongly agreed” with that sentiment, compared to 51% of Republicans."

Republican voters (74%) and independents (61%) believe speech should be legal “under any circumstances, while Democrats are almost evenly divided. A bare majority of Democrats (53%) say speech should be legal under any circumstances, while 47% say it should be legal “only under certain circumstances.”

Also it's worth noting that people generally don't live their values, as in they say one thing and do another, but I think it's still telling that there is a sizable conservative edge when it comes to at least the idea of free speech (regardless of the contents).

I would call myself a centrist, and hold opinions on varying issues that would be considered left-wing and right-wing depending on the issue. I will say, when talking to liberal friends, I exclusively say what I agree with them on, because I'm afraid that people will call me a "bigot" and "hateful" before I even have a change to defend myself . I'm not joking that when I told a friend "If I move to the States I would go to Texas cause I like lower taxes ... and would buy a gun for self-defense" the next day, they called me out for being a "trump supporter".

If I'm talking with conservative friends, I tell them exactly how I feel if I lean more left on a certain issue, cause I know we can actually talk about it. They'll try to change my minds, but generally it's still pretty respectful and they're not making all these assumptions about my character.

This is obviously all anecdotal, but I do see this happening online, where people who are more liberal shut down opposing opinions for being "hate speech", equating an opposing opinion to "literal violence" ([https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-tell-students-words-are-violence/533970/](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-tell-students-words-are-violence/533970/)) , and the good'ol "If you disagree with me you're hitler" (I found this in 30 seconds on the first post I saw in r/politics: [https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17lche7/comment/k7d5oqo/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17lche7/comment/k7d5oqo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).)

This definitely happens on both sides, but I can definitely feel it more on the liberal side, and the statistics that I cited support this.

Examples of this would be:

r/therewasanattempt's new rules: "No supporting Apartheid crimes against humanity", "No bootlicking cops - ACAB". (despite both of these being fairly controversial takes) among many other very prominent subreddits that I'm too lazy to list.

All those protests at college campuses you see whenever a conservative figure has a speech. (seriously they spent like 600k on Ben Shapiro's security at UC Berkley) I certainly can't think of a liberal speaking being shut down. I personally would like to hear people who I disagree with talk, and hopefully hear their perspective, but hey that's just me I guess.

The fact that the Twitter files, memes aside, actually did expose Twitter for shadowbanning conservatives. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/12/13/twitter-files-shadow-banning-conservatives-bari-weiss/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/12/13/twitter-files-shadow-banning-conservatives-bari-weiss/) (though I will say I don't use Twitter much so I'm less informed on this).
The key guiding principle between the two I currently see is which one wishes for government compelled speech. They can both be offended and push for their opinion to be represented. They can both criticise one another for not being open to hearing different opinions on different platforms. 
Now the one place it actually becomes complicated is when citizens funds are used to support the organizations platform or speech. So things like schools and libraries are matters of public scrutiny when they start to compel or sensor speech.
I don’t disagree with you overall, but I think there’s a fundamental distinction in how the two groups think about freedom in general.

I’m gonna make some generalizations about liberals and conservatives now so please forgive me in advance for that. I’m also gonna focus only on thought process, not anything legal, so I won’t distinguish private individuals vs the government, even though that is an important distinction. And I’ll also preface that I’m more liberal overall so I’m certainly biased. With that said…

Liberals, in general, think of free speech as “freedom to.” Freedom to say hate speech, but also freedom to fire or “cancel” someone because of that. Freedom to read and learn about gay and trans issues, but also freedom to protest those issues (and again, freedom to “cancel” someone because of that protest). Freedom to have an abortion if that’s what you want. 

Conservatives, on the other hand, have more of a “freedom from” mindset. Freedom from having to suffer consequences for objectionable speech. Freedom from having their kids learn about LGBT issues. Freedom from being forced to attend DEI trainings. Freedom from being exposed to viewpoints they find objectionable. Freedom from babies being aborted. 

Personally I think “freedom from” is a bullshit way to look at freedom because it just means eliminating someone else’s “freedom to,” but I see where they are coming from.
[Here's some polling showing that Republicans are more in favor of free speech than Democrats.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/real_clear_opinion_research/poll_is_censorship_a_partisan_issue_149790.html)

> Republican voters (74%) and independents (61%) believe speech should be legal “under any circumstances, while Democrats are almost evenly divided. A bare majority of Democrats (53%) say speech should be legal under any circumstances, while 47% say it should be legal “only under certain circumstances.”

> Nearly one-third of Democratic voters (34%) say Americans have “too much freedom.” This compared to 14.6% of Republicans. Republicans were most likely to say Americans have too little freedom (46%), while only 22% of Democrats feel that way. Independents were in the middle in both categories.

> Although majorities of Democrats, Republicans, and independents agree the news media should be able to report stories they believe are in the national interest, this consensus shifts when it comes to social media censorship. A majority of Democrats (52%) approve of the government censoring social media content under the rubric of protecting national security. Among Republicans and independents, this percentage is only one-third.
   
> Poll respondents were read this statement: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” Only 31% of Democratic voters “strongly agreed” with that sentiment, compared to 51% of Republicans.
   
> Fully three-fourths of Democrats believe government has a responsibility to limit “hateful” social media posts, while Republicans are more split, with 50% believing the government has a responsibility to restrict hateful posts. (Independents, once again, are in the middle.)
   
> Democrats are significantly more likely than Republicans to favor stifling the free speech rights of political extremists. Also, Republicans don’t vary by the group: Only about half of GOP voters favor censorship — whether asked about the Ku Klux Klan, Nazis, or the Communist Party.

As a leftist I find it very unfortunate.  I'm old enough to remember when Democrats were more reliably on the side of free speech.  I thought it was a matter of principle, and for some people it was, but I'm now realizing that many Democrats are willing to suppress free speech because they feel ascendant and they no longer worry that that same power will be turned against them.

Edit: ["The Iron Law of Institutions and the Left,"](https://medium.com/@jesse.singal/the-iron-law-of-institutions-and-the-left-333c42c246af) an essay I wish all my fellow leftists would read.  It relates to the topic of free speech, among other examples.
First, just want to point out that you are talking about our norms rather than our laws.  Neither side wants legal changes to the first amendment; both sides agree with the standards for limiting certain forms of speech, the difference is just in the assessment of the facts for when it's warranted or not.

In terms of free speech norms (e.g. how we tolerate or value diverse opinions; how we impose social consequences for saying bad things; our willingness to engage in discourse with political opponents; etc.), I think conservatives are actually in a position where they have to value free speech more because they no longer occupy the moral center of our country.  The standard values now are moderate-left liberalism and conservative traditions are steadily losing ground.  Conservatives need to commit themselves to engaging with discourse because they stand to lose the most when people shut down conversations out of a sense of disgust.
