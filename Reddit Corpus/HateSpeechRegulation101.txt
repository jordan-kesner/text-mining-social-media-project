It's deliberate, all the reich wing techbros like Musk, Zuck and all the others want a far right government in power.
Big tech companies have finally become part of the establishment.

Creating environments more likely to encourage right wing voters is exactly as establishment as you think it is.
Or, hear me out, maybe all this bullshit _is_ democracy. This is just what modern democracy looks like.

Sure, it sucks, but I'm getting pretty fucking tired of the dreary, daily "threat to democracy!" scare pieces.
Part of why I left FB is that their moderation and policies were a cruel joke to begin with. It's like a flashback to middle school where you punch someone for calling you the R-word and then you're the one who gets in trouble.
It's weird they think they will still be left to run their companies as they please. As if they wouldn't be seized under a far right regime if they stepped out of line
So you are saying that left wing Democrats can get in power by censoring content and right-wing conservatives can get power by not censoring it?
