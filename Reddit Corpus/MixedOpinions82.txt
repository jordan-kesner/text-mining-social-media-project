Title: CMV: Liberals should abandon identity politics and instead focus on class/economic issues

Post:
Identity Politics (IP) is largely unhelpful and extremely divisive. The focus on identity by liberals alienates other people on the left and creates huge distance from those in the middle and those on the right. Class/economic issues, such as wealth inequality and ending crony capitalism, are far more unifying messages for those who hold liberal ideology. Alleviating class/economic issues would also have downstream positive impact on many other issues (often championed by IP) such as racial inequality.

Proponents of IP get caught up too often in the characteristics of the individuals making political arguments â€“ practically by design. The speaker therefore is weighted according to inherent traits they happened to be born with (race, gender, sexual orientation). This creates an environment in which large portions of the population/electorate (i.e. straight, white, male) feel that their opinions and issues are valued less than others. The resulting atmosphere, exacerbated deliberately by right leaning talking points, causes many to abandon the left.

Class/economic issues should become the leading message for liberals, given the broader appeal it would naturally have. Discussing and championing issues of income distribution/poverty/corruption would reach a much larger population and could pull many in the middle and on the right back toward the left. This would not only be practically useful for political reasons, but would also have a net positive impact on many of the class-related social issues that we see in society.

Identity politics just helped get Donald Trump elected as President. His messages were targeted toward white, Christian Americans. White people made up [70%](https://news.vice.com/story/white-people-voted-to-elect-donald-trump) of all voters--[58%](https://news.vice.com/story/white-people-voted-to-elect-donald-trump) of white people voted for Trump, while only [21%](https://news.vice.com/story/white-people-voted-to-elect-donald-trump) of non-whites voted for Trump. The topics that President Trump talked about most during his campaign were directed at those white Christians and against people that were not in his base. This includes, immigration (predominately Hispanics), terrorism (predominately Muslims), etc. 83% of voters who want to deport illegal immigrants voted for Trump and 85% of voters who wanted to build a wall voted for Trump. [Source](http://www.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls). 73% of voters who think there is no racism in the criminal justice system voted for Trump. [Source](http://www.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls). Meanwhile, the majority of voters who were most concerned about the economy voted for Hillary ([52% vs. 41% for Trump](http://www.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls)) and the majority of voters who were most concerned with foreign policy also voted for Hillary ([60% vs. 33%](http://www.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls)). It seems that Hillary did a better job of recruiting those who were most concerned about economic issues, despite your assertion that, "Class/economic issues should become the leading message for liberals, given the broader appeal it would naturally have." Hillary already had the most voters who believed that economic issues were the most important issues. If anything, Donald Trump did a good job of recruiting voters who cared the most about kicking out illegal immigrants and fighting terrorism. The argument could be made that illegal immigration is tangentially related to economic issues, but terrorism still stands out as a non-economic issue.

Further, one party in the United States [gerrymanders based upon race](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/north-carolina-gerrymandering/527592/), tries to impose a [travel ban](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/trumps-tweets-may-have-sunk-his-travel-ban/529167/) to keep people out from majority Muslims countries, [supports racial profiling](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/25/politics/sheriff-joe-arpaio-donald-trump-pardon/index.html), [opposes LGBT rights](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-gops-anti-lgbt-anti-women-religious-freedom-law-on-steroids), etc. Each of these are actions taken against a class of people (based upon their identity), and is mainly supported by white Christians, who tend to vote Republican, and last year, for President Trump.

It may seem to you that (capital L) Liberals in the U.S. are the ones engaging in identity politics, but it is only because Liberals have a more diverse voting base. Republicans are predominantly white Christians, so all they have to do is try to relate to a more homogeneous base; thus, there is less glaring examples of identity politics. But, as you can see above, there are countless examples of identity politics being engaged in by the right in the U.S.
u/disguisedasrobinhood made  a really good point that I would like to expand on: 

*Who do you think the liberals are in the first place?*

You speak as if there would be a small group of leaders cynically and pragmatically setting course for a pre-determined agenda. 

In reality, "liberals" and "conservatives" are two huge swathes of the American population, who have grouped together and self-identified based on various historical circumstances. 

When a site like the Huffington Post posts both reports from Washington politics, and has a whole Queer Voices section, or when Jezebel posts both celebrity gossip and feminist manifestos, or when a movie reviewer on youtube disses Trump in one aside joke, and then defends Colin Caepernick in another, or when a Democratic congressional primary's participant tries to appeal all of the above people, that's not because some sort of Chief Liberal has issued a decree that identity politics is the official direction. 

It is because these are things that liberals *actually do believe in*, and because it's part of their subculture and lifestyles. Many liberals *are* in fact women, people of color, and LGBT, and they WILL talk about their unique political grievances on the same platforms where they talk about more universal politics. 

Asking liberals to stop talking about minority grievances, is like asking conservatives to stop talking about God. You can try,.. but you realize that most of them are *actually religious*, do you? It's not just something they were ordered to say, it is the way they really see the world.  Even if there would be a Chief Conservative to declare that they are secularizing the ideology, how would you enforce it on a population that wants to go on?  
You need to begin by qualifying what you think constitutes identity politics and why you think class is somehow not an identity?
I understand your argument is not one of fairness (you agree that identity issues exists and deserve solutions) but one of pragmatism: you conclude that, regardless of fairness, you can't affect change if you frame issues as problems of a minority. 
I think the weakness in your argument is evident when you look to the minority voters themselves: the moment you present an agenda that talks class/economic issues but doesn't explicitly connect the issue to minority identities, these minorities disengage.  You can see this through this thread: "you are wrong because minorities are oppressed and you can't ignore that". So your view would lose minority voters faster than it gains voters everywhere else.   
Someone said here right wing voters are willing to vote against their interest. I argue that left wing minority voters will vote against their interest on economic/class issues (by not showing up to vote) unless you frame them as identity politics.

Wait, isn't that identity politics? 
It is difficult if not impossible to discuss class/economic issues without engaging with identity politics. If black people are overrepresented in the criminal justice system and women are underrepresented in boardrooms, those are going to have major economic consequences which you would then be unable to discuss. You can't discuss corruption without discussing things like for-profit prisons or exploitation of immigrant labor, which have a significant racial component.

Discussing class without race is ignoring large parts of the issue.
Could you explain precisely what policies you would support regarding poverty and corruption?  "Corruption" especially is a very vague term that I have trouble connecting to policy, and US liberals of ANY stripe talk a lot about poverty (to the point that the so-called 'working class' feels excluded).

>  This creates an environment in which large portions of the population/electorate (i.e. straight, white, male) feel that their opinions and issues are valued less than others.

I see two things happen along these lines: 1. People complain that white men *dominate* various spaces and want more diversity... e.g. criticizing all-male panels,  boardrooms, and literature classes. 2. Telling white men not to speak for the *subjective experience* of others.

Are these what you're talking about?  Because I have often seen people say "liberals don't care about white men!" and I have very rarely heard a liberal actually say "I don't care about white men."  There's a misunderstanding happening somewhere.
Class/economic issues are identity politics.

The notion of the "ignored blue collar worker," for example, is 100% identity politics and has basically the same rhetoric surrounding it.
Let me try a different tack - I'll agree with your first premise - that liberals should abandon identity politics - but disagree with the second - and instead focus on class/economic issues - as the latter functionally identical to the initial premise. You've structured your argument thus: *We should stop doing X and instead do X*.

To wit, "class" is just as much a form of identity as race, gender or sexual preference. I think you attempt to make a distinction by suggesting a difference in that one is born with race, gender or sexual orientation, but I think that's a bit too simplistic. In terms of politics, even these supposedly inherent traits are fluid. A black person who voted for Trump is called a 'race traitor' or accused of 'acting white'. Of course, they are still the same race, but politically speaking their actions serve to exclude them from the identity group and their opinions are marginalized as much as if they were not a part of that group. In other words, even race, gender and sexual orientation become socially constructed groups for the sake of use in identity politics.

"Class" as you define it - along with economic issues which seem to tie back to class - is just a different form of identity politics. Like what you condemn, it appoints speakers with credibility or strips them of validity based on external traits. Like what you condemn, it creates separation rather than unification. Class inevitably pits people against one another, just like identity politics because it *is* identity politics.

Thus, your view is tautologically false (in logical terms). You negate and support the same position simultaneously.

*Bonus: This isn't part of the CMV, but if you're looking for a political paradigm to support that avoids the us vs. them approach, stop looking to the characteristics of people and instead identify problems and seek solutions. It's a subtle difference. Instead of 'helping the poor' try instead to 'reduce poverty'. This places the object of reform outside of people so that anyone can participate in the solution regardless of whether they, themselves, are directly affected by it.*
