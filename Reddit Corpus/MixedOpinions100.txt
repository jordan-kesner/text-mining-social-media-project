Title: [ANNOUNCEMENT] The Rise and Fall of AgentPanda: A Play in Three Acts

Post:
Good morning fellow MPers! We have an announcement to make that is sure to leave a bittersweet taste in our collective mouths. Our most loved and hated mod (according to our most recent polling), agentpanda, has decided to step down from the mod team. After some recent internal discussion we've collectively decided that this is what's best for him, the mod team, and the community at large. We know that the community will have mixed feelings about this, but let's keep the discussion civil and remember that there is a person behind every Redditer alias. **Law 1 will be in effect for this post, while Law 4 will be suspended.** 

Panda has written his own exit speech and has asked us to post it below. So, without further ado:

> This will be my final contribution to the subreddit as a moderator, and I want to thank our team for permitting me to share my views and reasons for leaving the team and broader subreddit in detail prior to my departure.

> Over the past year(s) I've grown to believe less and less in the core mission of our subreddit, and (most importantly) have less belief that the core tenets of such are shared by other users. As a refresher from our sidebar:

> *This subreddit is still a place where redditors of differing opinions come together, respectfully disagree, and follow reddiquette (upvote valid points even if you disagree). Republicans, Libertarians, Democrats, Socialists, Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Atheists, Redditors of all backgrounds are welcome!*

> I think we'd all agree (although in different places) that the core mission of the sub is one we all fail to live up to in some way day-to-day. I, however, have found myself giving in more and more to dismissing those with whom I disagree; and taking the bait on the prodding from users for whom 'winning' is more important than discourse. Over time this creates a negative impression of our (otherwise) dedicated moderation team among our userbase which is not conducive to faith in *their* continued dedicated leadership. It's incumbent on myself to not be a problem or timesink for them, or the subreddit at large.

> Our subreddit growth has created a flourishing community of contributors; many of whom are keen on sharing their viewpoints and opinions and endorsing our core mission— your viewpoints need not be moderate, but your expression thereof should be; and tempered under the idea that there is a human being on the other side of a screen somewhere reading what you have to say. I love and endorse *that* mission of our subreddit, and hope to bring it to life in a future project to create discourse and discussion on Reddit.

> In the interim, it's become abundantly clear to me that routinely being on the defensive side of the worst our users have to offer in our moderation/reporting queue and modmail has created a jaded perception of our userbase for me. Accordingly, I join several of our other retired mods that have stepped down from their duties and away from the subreddit entirely due to an inability or unwillingness (the latter, in my case) to conform with our core mission and trust in the good faith engagement of selected users.

> For those interested parties with whom reasonable discussion has been had in the past, feel free to join me in Discord where I'll hopefully remain relatively active— and/or drop me a line if you'd like to be kept up-to-date with regard to my future political discourse subreddit project!

> Cheers,

> agentpanda

I almost always disagree with agent, but I genuinely appreciate his comments and they always give me something to think about. I hope he sticks around as a user!

I get why agentpanda was acting like this, as I often feel the same way about those with whom I strongly disagree. And I have routinely taken the bait and been confrontational with people I view to be trolls.

The difference, however, has been that I was at risk of being banned/suspended, while agentpanda seemed to act with impunity. This was not a good look for the mod team or the subreddit.

I hope agentpanda sticks around as a rule-abiding commenter, but he did the right thing by stepping down as a mod. His departure will elevate the perceived integrity of the mod team and of the subreddit, which, for me, had ebbed in recent months.

Will sheffieldandwaveland take agentpanda's principled example? Time will tell.
As a longtime lurker, it was a bit sad to see agentpanda's development over the last months. I remember reading many takes that, even though I disagreed with them, were very interesting. In the last weeks, almost every post by him that caught my attention seemed to be in the spirit of "I am trying to be as mean and dismissive as possible without violating the rules". I would have preferred to read an apology for that behavior instead of what is essentially blaming other users for his own attitude, but I understand that it is difficult. I wish you all the best, agentpanda.

This sub's rules can sometimes be convoluted and confusing, and if mods have a vision for what they want the sub to be, they all need to lead by example.  /u/agentpanda's frequent line-stepping was a constant obstacle that prevented users from understanding and committing to those rules.

Good for him for recognizing and owning his failure to uphold them, and getting out of the way. A healthy dose of real life and fresh air will probably do him (and would probably do all of us) some good.
Cheers to all my friends, and thanks for the memories! Helping build and run MP the past years has been a blast. As I noted, you're welcome to find me in Discord where I'm usually around.

The haters, well— they know what they can do.
I’m a lurker but I just wanted to say that while I may not agree with everything AP posts, I always enjoyed reading his thoughts. I’ve had my mind changed or been compelled to think further on a topic many times just from reading all the different views expressed here. I hope that we continue to hear from all different voices. I don’t want to only hear my own opinions thrown back at me. I come here specifically to see what other people think and it’s helped me tremendously. Thanks again to AP and the other mods for keeping this sub going.
