Title: CMV: Gender identity should be based upon the genitals with which you were born with and the hormones your body naturally produces.

Post:
Hello everyone, with all the media coverage lately regrading transgender individuals I find myself uneducated on the particular subject and would love to be enlightened on the topic. I support the rights and henceforth of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals but can't wrap my head around the idea of transgenderism. From a purely medical/biological standpoint, it doesn't seem as if one should be able to claim to be the opposite gender when scientifically they have been classified to be the other. Even with the surgeries and artificial hormone replacements, wouldn't the artificial nature of these changes render the claim illegitimate? From a societal standpoint, obviously the idea of gender identity is one that has, for a majority of human history, been based around a singular core fact - we have two genders, man and woman, and you are either one or the other. Is there more to this perceived truth, or is transgenderism the result of a mental nuance that simply appears now because of the emergence of rights for the LGBT community, but has in fact, always been there?

This post isn't meant to attack/offend/etc. anyone, and again if I seem ignorant on the subject it is only because frankly I am and am only here to be educated. Thanks for any responses that can help me understand.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who's contributed (positively); I've learned a lot from this thread such as gender vs. sex, gender dysphoria, transgender vs. transsexual, etc. I definitely feel I have a better grasp of trans as a whole.

Well, to start off with, there's a big divide between biological sex and gender. I highly recommend you research this more, but I'll try to touch on the basics.

Sex is rooted in an organism's DNA, and is defined by which reproductive cells (sperm or eggs) they produce. Animals with testes who produce sperm are biologically male, and animals with ovaries who produce eggs are considered female. You're probably familiar with X and Y chromosomes, which is how sex is determined in humans, right?

Actually, things go wrong. [Swyer Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_gonadal_dysgenesis) is a big example, in which a person has an XY chromosome but something goes wrong with the Y. Humans are actually female by default, and the Y chromosome is required to activate in order to form male parts. Without it, people with Swyer develop uteri, vaginae, and other normal female organs. However, they have streak gonads which don't produce sperm OR eggs. So what do you call them? Their chromosomes say male. Their organs say female. But they can't reproduce as either one. This is just one of many examples of conditions that show how sex is not even nearly as straightforward as it seems when everything goes normally.

So, this is only half the problem. Now we need to address gender. While there are several definitions of gender, some of which address biology, the accepted definition in most of the social sciences is the combination of external and internal social features that are associated with masculinity or femininity. These usually, but not often, correlate with sex. But for obvious reasons, people who lack an easily definable sex might also be hard to correctly gender. But, clearly, these people aren't genderless, they still have elements of masculinity and/or femininity. That leads us to the question: if gender can be rooted in something that isn't biology, isn't it always rooted in something else, at least partially?

The easy answer is a person's feelings. Hormones, body structures, socialization, and a thousand other things can feed into how we perceive our gender, leading to the inevitable conclusion that gender is determined primarily by how we act and how others act towards us.

Imagine, if you will, that you find out tomorrow you actually have two X chromosomes. I'm assuming you're male, or at least you think you are. But for all you know, your genitals are the product of elaborate surgery when you were an infant- you actually were born with a vagina and streak gonads, but your clitoris was large enough that doctors were able to turn it into a penis and give you testicular implants. I'll admit, it's far-fetched, but in the end it's very hard to know our sex for certain until we've conceived a child or had serious testing done. But let's assume it happens. Would you immediately ask for breast implants, get your facial hair permanently removed, and start dating men while considering yourself straight? Probably not, right? Your gender goes deeper than just what you understand your body to be.

Similarly, if you were abducted by aliens and had your sex switched against your will, do you think you would still identify with your prior gender?

Now, don't get me wrong. There's a heavy correlation between sex and gender for a reason, and part of that is biology. Testosterone does correlate with aggressive, masculine behavior. But there are plenty of aggressive women, right? And while pregnancy does cause mothers to form a tight chemical bond with their children, there are fathers out there who form just as close of an emotional connection without being pregnant. Our bodies might make it easier to act as our gender, might give us the right chemical cues and biological urges, but they do not define everything we feel.

Furthermore, gender isn't even so much about feelings as it is the way we act. Crossdressing proves this- a convincing crossdresser knows how to present themselves as the opposite gender, to the point where few people will ever guess their sex doesn't "match up". Have you ever wanted to wear a dress, just to see what it's like? Wished someone would bring you flowers or pick you up for prom or be the big spoon? Maybe you wanted to wear pink or high heels or makeup? You could even enjoy baking or childcare or color-organizing your sock drawer, for all I know. Ovaries don't make someone any more likely to enjoy the color pink than testicles do, these things are based in our personal preferences and how we were socialized as kids.

Being transgender means that your genitals don't match up with the gender that you relate most to. Most of us have some preferences and behaviors that don't line up with our gender, like tbulldykes. They are clearly able to have these masculine feelings, preferences, and behaviors while still identifying as a woman. However, is it so hard to believe that they could have a few more of those preferences, pushing them into predominantly masculine territory? People fall all over the spectrum; we do a lot of policing to tell children what they're "supposed" to do and like, but if you watch toddlers at play when they're still too young to have this solidly internalized, you'll see there are a good number of girls who run with the boys and boys who play house with the girls. Being transgender later in life is just like that on a more complex scale, having preferences that are mostly feminine when you have testes or masculine when you have ovaries.

Basically, our bodies don't define what we think, feel, and do. From a biological standpoint of sex, maybe we really can't change. But from a social and cultural point, it's not only possible, it's fairly easy.
* Men and women both produce testosterone and estrogen. There is just a slightly different balance depending on sex.

* The seam in the middle of a man's scrotum (ball sack) is where his potential labia sealed shut.

* The clitorus is a small version of what becomes the penis in males.

* Men who are insensitive to testosterone can look like women all the way until puberty. Then when the body starts producing dihydrotestosterone, which they are sensitive to, they suddenly grow testicles and become like men.

* If you increase the ratio of estrogen to testosterone, men can grow breasts pretty easily. This is a famous plot point in Fight Club.

* There is a long scientific history of people being born intersex.

* There is a long cultural history in many parts of the world where there are more than two genders. It's only been recently, and though much effort on the part of the Christian (both Catholic and Protestant) church to establish only two genders as the main cultural norm.

* If trans people could take a pill to make them happy in their culturally assigned gender, I bet many of them would do it. It sucks when your brain tells you one thing about your body, and your body tells you something else. But right now, we can't really change the brain, but we can change the body. 

* If it makes people happy, who cares?
Well, first off there is [a long history of human cultures dealing with more than 2 genders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_gender#History), so that part of your argument is just factually incorrect.  Secondly, I think approaching this from a standpoint of looking for evidence to prove a claim is misguided.  Trans people are not trying to pretend to be another gender and pull the wool over everyone else's eyes; in fact, in the suicide rate among trans people is unbelievably high compared to those conforming to the current male/female standard and even to LGBT people.  They don't wish they were trans, they wish they were born in the body they feel their minds were meant for, and that dysmorphia is incredibly hard to deal with.

Beyond all that, there *is* [mounting scientific evidence](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20032-transsexual-differences-caught-on-brain-scan.html#.VW0e0M9Viko) that what causes people to be trans is not some desire for attention or to be different, but actually represented by physiological differences in the brain from non-trans people.

Look, I used to think about it like you do, so I don't look down on you for being ill-informed.  Quite the contrary; I applaud your desire to test the opinions you have and see if they hold true.  In my case, after talking to some trans people online and researching the matter, I've come to a place where I don't feel it really even my place to tell someone what they can or cannot identify as, so long as it's genuine.  There's no good reason to mock someone whom we may perceive as weird, and no good reason to try and convince them to be not weird to us.
The problem, as I see it, is that gender *expression* is very much a 'grey area' and has been getting greyer and greyer as time marches forward.

You suggest (rightly, I believe) that for most of human history - gender and sex were pretty easily linked. Men had penises, fought wars, did physical labor, and had sex with women. Women had vaginas, birthed children, did domestic labor, and had sex with men. 

That doesn't mean, however, that these roles worked for everyone. I'm sure that, since the beginning of human history: there have been women who would have loved to pick up a sword or men who were most comfortable caring for children. I *know* that there have been men who had sex with men and women who had sex with women since time immemorial. 

All of these things: the fighting, the baby-making, the physical vs. nurturing labor - that's *gender*. The book that influenced me most was *Gender Trouble* by Judith Butler (which I would encourage you to read, but it's pretty dense), in which the basic thesis is: *all* gender is a performance - men who act like men are 'performing' just as much as men who act like women, or women who act like men, etc. etc. etc. It's easier and more accepted for a man to behave like a 'man', but that doesn't make it any less of a 'performance' or more authentic. The fact that males behaving like 'men' is tradition doesn't make it more 'real'. 

I, personally, reject the notion that the tiny, tiny biological differences between male and female humans account for the tremendous variance in traditional social behavior. Men may *tend* toward certain interests, vocations, or attitudes: but I think this is socialization much more than genetics. I know my 6'2, 180lbs, Division A athelete little sister is taller and has more muscle mass than I do - yet she identifies as a woman and I identify as a man - even though she has the more traditionally 'masculine' body. 

Ultimately, there is such huge variation in how people experience and perform gender - it doesn't make sense to reduce it to what's between your legs. I know giant, beardy dudes who love kitties and cry at movies and petite, feminine girls who can drop, dress, and clean a buck better than most men. With so much variation in gender performance - if a male wants to identify as a 'woman' or a female wants to identify as a 'man': more power to 'em. For the biological acts of sex and reproduction: genitals might be important. For everything else, I don't really think it matters. 
I used to believe "gender identity"  was defined purely by genitals (and as a direct consequence,  by hormones)  as well.  In fact,  I used to say,  why do you even attempt to identify as a "gender"?  Gender doesn't exist,  the only thing that exists is your "sex",  and that is the only thing as actually matters,  right? 

Well.... No,  it is not that simple. There are two videos that I have seen that made me accept that there is some truth to the idea that gender actually does exist. 

I must note that I *think* there are two types of transgender people. A type that has an inclination towards the social gender of the other sex (for example,  a male who would like to wear makeup because he likes it,  but is shamed for that choice just because "makeup is for women"). And another type that their biological gender identity doesn't match up with their physical sex. Now this one is weirder to understand, it is called "gender dysphoria", and you probably wouldn't even notice your biological gender identity unless something was wrong with it. I know I had issues understanding the problem. 


So with that,  you should watch two videos. 

The first is Hjernevask episode 7, where they talk about and discuss the case of David Reimer, who was raised to be socialized as a female (girl), but none of that actually worked,  and still realized that something was "wrong" and in the end even changed his name to David Reimer, as you can see. And also shows a case of intersex people who were in-between at birth, and doctors randomly picked the wrong sex for them.

And also a video from a transgender person,  who is by default female, but identifies as a male. Or at least would do her best to match what she feels would be right for her body. I think the way she (he) talks about it is very informative in making you understand just how deep those feelings of "feeling that one should be the other sex and not their own".

To be fair,  I still can't really get myself to use the pronouns based on gender rather than sex,  but I just prefer to use singular 'they' instead. 

So in the end,  what matters is that biological gender identity does exist,  and anything that exists in the human body can break and malfunction. This is yet again one of those things. The brain is complex, and complex systems have a tendency for error. 

I don't expect you to understand it perfectly, neither do I. We are the same gender that you were assigned at birth. Of course it is an alien concept to us that someone would want to change their gender. 

Just like how you don't fully understand how a man can be bisexual and attracted to men and women. Sure, you can think that they think of men as women, but that doesn't really capture the truth (speaking as a bisexual man). Just like how I can't quite understand how you can't be attracted to an entire gender. I used to think everyone was bisexual but just hid it.

But since this is such an alien concept to us we have to question why people would claim to not be their birth gender. As a Cis Male I would never claim to be a woman. I would get nothing from this except pain and social exclusion. So why would I ever say this or get surgery and cut my penis off?

I only see one option. They truly believe that they should be the other gender and are going to take all the steps to change their gender as fully as possible. Yes, it isn't genetically ideal. Just like being gay isn't genetically ideal as you can't reproduce. But it is the only option for happiness for many.

To your point about history, transgendered people are nothing new. There has been the idea of a [Third gender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_gender) in many old societies and cultures, but not in many modern ones. And transgender people have been referenced throughout history. Of course surgery and hormones are new, but crossdressing was a common practice.
Suppose someone kidnapped you and forced a sex-change on you, giving you the genitals and hormones of the opposite sex.

Would it change the sex you thought of yourself as?

If someone argued the point by pointing at all the other-sex features your body had, would it change your mind?

I doubt it; your brain would still be wired up as it is now - surgery wouldn't change who you *are*, it would just wrap that identity in a different meat suit.

So follow that thought one step further: what if you'd been born that way, wrapped in a meat suit that didn't match what your brain considered itself to be?

If you then had the meat suit altered so that it finally matched your brain's self-perception, how would you feel about being told it didn't count?
There are a few things to unpack here.

Transgenderism isn't a claim to physically be the opposite sex.  It's a state of being in which a person's sense of self - in reference to their sex - is incongruent with what their physical sex was at birth.  The vast majority of transgender people are very aware of the physical realities, and this recognition leads to a phenomenon that is going to be referred to a lot: **gender dysphoria** (discontent with one's physical body as a result of an opposite-sex sense of self).

Now that transgender 101 is out of the way, addressing a few other points:

> Even with the surgeries and artificial hormone replacements, wouldn't the artificial nature of these changes render the claim illegitimate?

I don't see why something becoming changing qualities artificially or after its origin makes it less legitimate than something that began with those qualities.  A crippled person who receives a fully-functional mechanical leg is no longer crippled, at least not to the same degree.  A yellow car that is painted blue is no less blue than a car that left the factory with a blue coat of paint.  

> been based around a singular core fact - we have two **genders**, man and woman, and you are either one or the other.

Something that's going to come up in a conversation on transgender issues is the definition of the word gender.  Here, you use it as a synonym for biological sex.  However, in the context of gender politics (of which transgender issues is a part), gender is instead used as a shorthand of either "gender identity" or "gender role".  You may see this as silly semantics, but recognizing this distinction is crucial to understanding what the hell anyone else is talking about when it comes to these matters.
The way I think about it is this: A transexual is a person who has the instincts of one sex, but the chromosomes and hormones of another. There is something in the brain that tells a bull that it should mount cows and fight other bulls and do all of that bull-stuff. A female to male transexual is biologically female, but has that thing in their brain that makes them do man stuff (which is not just wanting to have sex with women, but some complex web of instincts and expectations that we don't have the knowledge about at the moment to properly define).

My view was pretty much the same as yours until I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8psrsdyezkU&feature=youtu.be&t=48s), and something clicked. It's a bit rambling and the main point is about half way though, but the whole thing shows that the entire idea of sex and gender is complex as hell.
