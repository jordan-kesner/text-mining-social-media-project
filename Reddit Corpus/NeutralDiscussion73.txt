So many people aren’t understanding the situation yet. The first amendment probably doesn’t matter anymore. The law doesn’t even really matter. We elected a sociopathic felon who leads a large violent cult. He has control of every branch of government.
Why do people keep believing anything can stop him? Trump and company have discovered that the Constitution is like an Order of Protection, nothing but a piece of paper. We all know no one has ever violated an Order of Protection before.
Broadcast licenses are only for over the air signals. Cable stations/signals are not regulated by the FCC. These idiots do not understand anything about the government departments they are taking over.
When will these people understand that the constitution won't stop him. Whoever thinks this needs to wake the fuck up already. 
Oh look the republicans are acting exactly like the Nazis did during the rise to power.  Yet again proving calling the republcians modern day Nazis is 100% accurate.
