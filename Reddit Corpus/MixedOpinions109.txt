Title: Protests, Riots, Terrorism, and You

Post:
I'll attempt to be short here, but that's a relative term.

The right to protest in the US is enshrined in the First Amendment:

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or **the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.**

There's been some hay made recently (to put it lightly) over whether the BLM protests in Portland, or the Trump protests were *mostly* peaceful, in the usual attempt to separate out who to condemn in either case. Partisanship abounds: chances are good that disliking progressive liberalism goes along with considering BLM protests altogether illegitimate, just as disliking Trump hangs together with condemning yesterday's protests. In both cases, the select parts of both which involved riots and rioters led to their opponents labeling the violence "acts of terrorism". This is *not ok*.

'Terrorism' is a word that has been bandied about in increasing amount since the Bush-Iraq war, and to detrimental effect. The vague and emotional use of the term has led some to believe that it means *any* politically-motivated violence. This is wholly inaccurate. Rioters are by definition distinct from terrorists, because [terrorism is not a tactic employed at random](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/abs/do-terrorists-win-rebels-use-of-terrorism-and-civil-war-outcomes/4729B2B926904616190DC38DB3240C8F). Terrorist acts are defined first and foremost by being *intentional*, and riots are first and foremost defined by being *spontaneous*. Terrorism is a uniquely violent, hateful frame of mind that prioritizes one's own political goals over the lives of others. Riots, on the other hand, are *instigated* when an frenzied attitude takes hold of a group of angry, passionate, and overstimulated people who momentarily discover themselves (or at least believe themselves to be) free from the restraints or censure of any law or judgement of their behavior.

The right to protest is primarily our individual right to have a "redress of grievances", and this is the part where the equivalence between BLM and MAGA protests break down. Public assembly is necessary as a way of preventing the use of government power to casually dismiss complaints by individuals with no power; *peaceable* assembly is required so that the public group bringing their complaints can have them addressed in an orderly fashion. As is often the case however, when the values and goals of two large groups come into conflict, violence *can* arise by the simple fact that their is already a tension present between the people and the government, so the focus and blame must lie with the *instigators* of any rioting that arises.

When the pushback on protestors bringing a legitimate grievance includes the disrespectful attitude that even the violations claimed "aren't happening", tensions are heightened, and instigation to riot may very well be touched off by any show of force, by either the protesting group themselves, or the government. If the authorities in power insist on not addressing the grievances brought before them, they are derelict in upholding the First Amendment. Now, if you read this carefully, note this applies to *both* the BLM, and MAGA protests.

The problem is whether the violations of rights, and perception of "going unheard" has a basis in reality or not. Trump's words, as usual, managed to dress up a kernel of legitimate issue -- the concern we all have to have free, fair, and accurate elections -- was dressed with a sizable helping of outright lies and fabrications. But keep in mind that telling the protestors that their protests are illegitimate is equally incorrect; what's wrong is the perception that the elections were *not* fairly held, and *that* is the single, big lie, told by Trump himself, who is *solely to blame*. He is the Great Instigator here, and not our fellow r/MP'ers, many of whom may choose to align with the completely correct notion that the election deserves to be investigated; and choosing to disbelieve the results reported on of an investigation by the government itself is a *problem*, but not seditious or un-American. No government "deserves" the benefit of the doubt without said government's full and candid transparency. Nor is it crazy to demand this transparency, nor is it a failing of character to trust people who happen to lie and disbelieve that the government is as candid and transparent as it claims to be; that would be blaming the *victims* of said liars, when the blame lies with the liars themselves.

**tl;dr:** Terrorists have goals; rioters do not. Equating rioters with terrorists is a character attack and deserves to be treated as such. Debate the point in abstract here as you like.

Please keep that in mind as you comment.

It's accurate to say that the people at the capitol yesterday were a mix of terrorists, rioters and protestors.  Protestors being the largest group, they stayed outside with their signs and flags and megaphones and did nothing outside the realm of good, constitutionally protected protest.  A smaller (yet still sizable) portion of people were rioters who assaulted police, engaged in property destruction, trespass, breaking and entering, and vandalism inside the halls and rooms of the capitol building.  A very small (yet still alarming) group of people were terrorists with premeditated plans of violence - they came with firearms, pipebombs, molotovs, zipties and other weapons.
Didnt the people invading the capitol yesterday have a clear goal of disrupting the count of the electoral votes?  It was planned for weeks and encouraged by the president. Some of them had even printed shirts about what they were doing with the date on them lol. I’m sure some people there were just caught up in the moment, but many of them had a clear goal yesterday
tl;dr I think it is equivocation to compare BLM to yesterday's events; yes, these are both "protests," but the similarities taper off pretty quickly after that.  I wouldn't go so far as to call the people yesterday "terrorists" (and fully agree that term is Bush-era propaganda at best) but I also wouldn't call them "protestors."

I want to push back on a few things in this post (and, more generally, some things Americans seem to take for granted).

First and foremost is this assumption: **"good" protests must be "lawful" and "peaceful."**  Americans take this entirely for granted, and it isn't that simple.

In [Letter from a Birmingham Jail](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html), Martin Luther King Jr. writes (salient portions lifted):

>You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: "How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?" The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. **One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.** I would agree with St. Augustine that "an unjust law is no law at all."

In other words, if a law is "unjust," we have a moral obligation not to adhere to it.

How do we determine if a law is "just"?

>A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is difference made legal. By the same token, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal. Let me give another explanation. A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that state's segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single Negro is registered. Can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structured?  
>  
>...

>Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.

Furthermore:

>I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out. **In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy.** One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.

So, let's apply this thinking to BLM (and, more broadly, policing in America): is there an unjust application of laws against persons of color in the United States?

This is.... broad and messy and debatable.  It isn't a simple question to answer.  When I look at the arguments and evidence, I lean towards: yes, people of color face an unjust application of the law in this country.  Given the history of slavery, segregation and discrimination in this country, there's certainly a basis for it.

Lastly, when we're talking about the BLM protests, we're talking about a very diverse set of protests among many American cities with disparate groups, many of which were orderly, some disorderly--it isn't as cut and dry as one would think.  Were some of the protests reasonable and ethical?  Sure, probably.  Were some of them unjust, unruly mobs?  Sure, probably.

Now let's apply the situation to 2020's claims of electoral fraud.  Is there an unjust application of law in the 2020 elections?  **No, I've seen no evidence this is the case.** To quote [Mitt Romney,](https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-statement-certification-presidential-election-results)

>More Americans participated in this election than ever before, and they made their choice. President Trump’s lawyers made their case before scores of courts; in every instance, they failed. The Justice Department found no evidence of irregularity sufficient to overturn the election. The Presidential Voter Fraud Commission disbanded without finding such evidence.

So, gaggles of courts across multiple jurisdictions found no compelling evidence or arguments.  Trump's own justice department found no evidence of irregularity.  A voter fraud commission found no evidence. And I've personally dug into information myself to see if there was fraud, and I've found nothing.  In many instances, it almost seems like the people providing the evidence of electoral fraud are deliberately and intentionally distorting the truth.

Having the facts on your side *matters*.  Having truth on your side *matters*.  If there's evidence of significant electoral fraud, I'd like to see it, but so far, let's not mince words: **there isn't any.**

But even worse is: **not only is their cause unfounded, but their cause is unjust.**  **In the absence of evidence, they seek to disenfranchise 81 million American votes.  They apply this claim of electoral fraud only to the office of President, despite the same electoral process being conducted in state, local and federal elections.  They apply this claim only to states Trump lost.  That's absurd; that isn't an equal application of the law, and thus it is unjust.**

Lastly, unlike BLM, **this is an isolated incident.**  Several thousand Trump supporters stormed the capitol building, forcibly entered, and (based on my perception of the facts) attempted to disenfranchise a plurality of American voters.  It's a much more simple event to understand in that regard.

I would not go so far as to call the people who trashed the capital yesterday "terrorists," but calling them "protestors" is also incorrect.  Their protest lacks evidence.  Their protest is in actuality unjust based on current understanding of the evidence.  Their protest was not lawful.  That is no "protest" in my mind; only an angry mob.
Many here seem very focused on us not knowing the inner mental state, the inner motivations, of everyone there.   Problem is if I break into a building on a lark with a few guys, but one of them pulls out a gun and shoots someone, I too am legally culpable.  This is why even getaway drivers who never entered the place of robbery have been convicted of murder.   

No one cares what's in your *heart*.  The inner state of your soul is not under contention.  If you stormed the Capitol on a lark as a lighthearted fellow, but your accomplice brought along zip ties to kidnap himself a Senator, that's still what you took part in.  

That doesn't mean everyone protesting at all, even blocks away on a street corner, is complicit.  We're talking about the storming of the US Capitol, not the mere holding of a Trump sign.
If I can attempt to remove my emotions from the situation, my focus is on the preparations of security. 

This was not a protest that sprung up out of nowhere. This was a preplanned Trump rally. The DC area knew there was a group of people coming that were upset about an election getting stolen. 

Where was the capital security? Why was the national guard denied? Would there have been a bigger clash if the protesters were met with lines of riot police? If they were continually pushed back by a large armed force? If they were pepper sprayed and tear gassed?

I get that media will hype up these situations and play to emotions, but watching plenty of documented BLM protests/riots from over the summer, the police forces preparation alone was a 180 degree difference.

Why? How? How does this disparity occur?
I think the intent was clear. The FBI found explosives put in both chambers and (just heard on NPR's 1A that they found a cooler full of Molotov cocktails. Many were armed going into and passed the signs clearly saying weapons not allowed. The directive came from Trump and Giuliani (who said they needed to do a trial by combat earlier at the same protest). So yes, they had a directive: to disrupt our democracy. They brought weapons and bombs with them to a "peaceful" protest. Seems clear to me.
You know, I vehemently disagree with this hair-splitting specifically for the people who stormed the capitol building, but you really should have put up a meta post clarifying this before banning a slew of people in yesterday's only thread.
There were IEDs placed at the RNC and DNC headquarters.

I’m glad there’s no such crime as domestic terrorism. The Patriot Act has a very loose definition of it, but it’s not a crime — it’s a label that authorizes federal agencies to investigate people and organizations. The definition is this:

> activities that (A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the U.S. or of any state; (B) appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S.

(Edit: The definition is way, way too vague for me. I’d like a stricter definition. But that definition should include trying to blow up government buildings to prevent an election from being lawfully certified.) 

This is one of the few cases where I think the Patriot Act would be useful. It’s very likely there were organized militias and other groups involved in the protest. There were also plenty of Trump supporters there who really believe the election was stolen and hadn’t premeditated anything. 

The organized groups should be investigated. Our elected politicians were hiding under their desks yesterday, fearing for their lives as people with guns tried to break down the door to the House floor and bombs were planted.
The people who planted the pipe bombs outside both the DNC and RNC are terrorists. I'd argue the dude in the house chamber holding about a dozen zips to handcuff house and senate members with is even worse than that. I'm sure the majority of the people who got in were participating in some amount of herd intoxication and were pretty spontaneous in their act. That does not detract from the fact that people were there intentionally instigating and prepared - again, you don't bring restraints into a government building spontaneously. There is no doubt in my mind at least a dozen if not a few dozen people had aims here. This is strikingly similar to what they had planned/wanted to do in Michigan.
