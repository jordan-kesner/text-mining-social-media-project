Title: Social Media and News Consciously Uncouple

Post:
I find news fascinating and most important in a society where freedom of speech is a right. News has affected the US elections......likely every US election. Social media was the epicenter of news during recent elections.

This recent [Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/11/social-media-news-readership-decline/675890/) article really makes me think about what happens during an election year when interest in the news has waned in adults. 

Will most be inclined to do the research and look for the truth in oceans of information on candidates?

Is the break up of news and social media a good thing or not?

I can't begin to fathom the answer to both those questions.

“Is the break up of news and social media a good thing?”  
Abso-fucking-lutely. News has (or is supposed to have) standards, accountability, fact checking, and corrections.  
Social media is entertainment, where the most outrageous, divisive, and titillating content wins.  
There should be a clear division, where news is based on facts and social media is reactions and opinions about those facts, clearly labelled as such.
The amount of people treating news and social media as equivalent in terms of accuracy is mind melting.
Just generally Americans aren’t very tech savvy and give unregulated random websites the same weight (as measured in truth) as highly structured news media who have survived decades. Those media have survived because they follow rigorous standards of journalism. They attempt to tell what they have verified is truth. 

The internet world of news is unregulated and will put out any information they think will make money. 

Money vs Truth

It’s a hard choice I know. I keep my head attached by looking for and consuming the media known for decades of truth telling. For most of our lives they were all we had.
Agreed, even worse is that money is winning over truth… old media channels are struggling and failing to compete financially with social media. The loss of local newspapers and regional reporting is a real shame.
