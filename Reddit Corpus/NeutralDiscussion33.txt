Highlights:

* 26% of Americans have a favorable opinion of the news media
* 35% of Americans say most national news organizations can be relied on to deliver the information they need.
* 23% believe most national news organizations care about the best interests of their readers, viewers and listeners.
* 50% feel most national news organizations intend to mislead, misinform or persuade the public.
* 50% say there is so much bias in the news media that it is often difficult to sort out the facts.
* Perceptions of political bias in news coverage have also increased, with independents driving the trend, followed by Republicans, then Democrats.
* 71% of those with low emotional trust in national news organizations believe that the people who really "run" the country are unknown to the voters; only 46% of those with high trust believe this.
* 65% of those with low emotional trust in national news organizations think official government accounts of events cannot be trusted, while only 22% of those with high trust say so.
* Americans with lower emotional trust in national news are much less likely to value the opinions of experts than those with high emotional trust.
* 70% of Americans with high emotional trust in national news organizations believe elections are free and fair, just 22% of those with low emotional trust say the same.

The news media is the fourth estate or the fourth pillar of our democracy, so these low levels of trust are alarming indeed. We rely on the media to accurately report the actions of our government and hold them to account.

The reason for my posting this is: What is causing this decline in America's trust of national media?

Are national media truly being corrupted and used to push one agenda or another? Are social media echo chambers causing Americans to reject contradictory information when they encounter it? Are politicians and political influencers trying to undermine trust for their own ends?

I think the answer to all those questions is 'yes' to some degree, but I'm curious what others think about it.

What I want to see is the percentage of people that for some reason trust news from a random YouTuber or Tiktoker than a news media company. It's probably a scary high number. 

How do I know that people on YouTube or TikTok have multiple independent sources and can remain impartial when relaying the news?
News reporting is being lumped together with commentary and analysis, and it’s leading to a lot of spin and, in general, a bad media landscape.

If you read a good AP news article, it will provide a summary of events, but not editorialize the story. Any facts are attributed to their sources for the reader. Any commentary/analysis is attributed to the analyst providing it and often balanced out with an opposing analyst for a rounded perspective.

Partisan media does not do any of the above or is inconsistent in doing the above. Even NYT, CNN and some of the more respected “main stream” sources editorialized their reporting. Rather than carefully qualifying every statement with “allegedly” or “according to”, they will treat certain information as true even though it is still only a claim made by some biased source. Even if sources are cited, stories are overloaded with one sided analysis; good analyst are quoted without all of their qualifying statements and bad analysis “hot takes” get the same treatment as good ones. That isn’t to say that all analysis is wrong, it’s just that it’s not a useful way for highly-discerning individuals to digest and process facts.
We're getting what we deserved. If Americans truly valued quality journalism then we would put money into it. The truth is that we fund and support the complete garbage and then complain about it.
This wood be less of a problem if people applied these beliefs equally regards of source. But you know that if their preferred propaganda outlet was split out, these values would inverse.
I think Matt Yglesias has a [pretty good take one this](https://www.slowboring.com/p/why-you-cant-trust-the-media) which is that the media landscape is extremely fragmented and competitive in a way that wasn't true 30 or 40 years ago. Technology and the American media market's vast size have led to a huge proliferation of outlets competing for different audiences. When one of these outlets screws up, which they all inevitably do, their competitors will pounce and point this out to their own viewers. This creates a loop, where viewers retreat into their own echo chambers and will pounce on any mistakes from media on "the other side." 

As Yglesias points out, media these days is pretty decent in reporting facts. You have access to information way more easily today compared to a few decades ago. Something like FDR's disability or JFK's infidelity probably wouldn't be hidden by the press, like it was decades ago. That was only possible in the highly consolidated press of the early and mid-20th century. Maybe CNN isn't reporting on Hunter Biden's laptop, but you can find information and updates on it pretty easily if you're inclined to. The question is how are various outlets using the facts and selecting them to tell a narrative. Ymmv on which outlets you think do this the most, but as long as that echo chamber spiral exists, it'll create mistrust.
One of the ways you destroy a nation is to destroy the people’s faith in institutions meant to preserve freedom, like journalism. Every autocrat in history made their first order of business the destruction of people who could tell everyone what was happening. In some cases they just arrested or murdered the journalists. That wouldn’t work in the United States because too many would question the executions of people they watch on TV. No, discredit the entire industry and make people believe OAN or Daily Kos are no different from AP and Reuters. That’s the way to destroy a nation.
The problem is what is media? Some dude at home like Matt Walsh spewing hate can claim to be the media. The media is a broad term that includes lots of individuals and organizations. Moreover, the right has moved further to the right so they expect the media to follow. Organizations like NPR that provide the least biased news are seen as biased by the far right.
