Title: A 16 year old high school student was arrested for hate speech she wrote on social media. This is as unconscionable as it is unconstitutional. Tar and feathers.

marxists post anti white shit all the time. they'll never be arrested of course, it's all part of the plan

hate speech laws are just one of the tools marxists will use to exterminate you, which is literally their goal, "overthrow the oppressor"

their goal is not to live peacefully with the oppressor.
Can’t we have a free speech martyr that isn’t a raging cunt? That law needs to be struck down ASAP. And hope this girl doesn’t get trotted out as a 1A hero. But maybe I’m asking for too much.
“Hate speech is protected speech in America. Citizens cannot be charged with a crime for expressing racist opinions. People can call for hate crime punishments all they want, but the First Amendment, as written and currently enforced, simply doesn't allow them.”
Just being racist is punishable? I thought America had the laxest free speech laws! Sucks ass, since here in nordics, you won't get arrested for that.
