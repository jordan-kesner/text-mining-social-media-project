Title: The current best way to help put a stop to these racially motivated mass shootings (like the ChristChurch New Zealand, El Paso Texas, and now Buffalo New York shootings) is to address and refute the arguments these killers use to try justifying said shootings. Blaming Trump or Carlson isn't helping.

Post:
# Introduction

Once again, America experiences another racially motivated mass shooting. This time, in New York, the state I live and grew up in. Also once again, I see people on reddit, articles [like this one](https://www.salon.com/2022/05/16/buffalo-this-is-where-donald-race-fantasies-lead/), [celebrities](https://twitter.com/robreiner/status/1525771154375458817), and politicians, trying to pin this on various factors, this time mainly on Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, and lack of mental health care, while other politicians seize this opportunity to push for more draconian gun control measures.

None of these 4 things (blaming Donald Trump, blaming Tucker Carlson, blaming the shooters' mental health, or blaming the lax gun laws of either America or any state within America) have been helping deal (or will help in dealing) with this mass shooting crisis. Here's why.

# Donald Trump

Donald Trump has been out of the white house, and laying low, for over a year now, making it pretty much impossible for him to in any way be some kind of motivator to the Buffalo New York shooter. The El Paso shooter stated in his manifesto that his "opinions on automation, immigration, and the rest predate Trump and his campaign for president" meaning he was planning his attack (and had his reasons for planning it ready) long before Donald Trump even ran for president. The ChristChurch shooter stated in his manifesto that while he may agree with Donald Trump in 1 or 2 certain areas, he overall doesn't support, and never did support, Donald Trump either.

# Tucker Carlson

As for Tucker Carlson, I have yet to find any footage of him actually declaring outright that non-white people are threatening to outbreeding, kill off, and eventually "replace" white people — the main fear the ChristChurch New Zealand and Buffalo New York shooters used to try justifying their respective attacks. The only "replacement" Tucker Carlson mentioned on Fox so far that I've seen was when he was only expressing concerns that certain political parties were trying to import future voters from outside America solely to have them vote against America's interests, and that those future voters would vote in favor of the very policies they fled from. If an immigrant comes to America to flee poverty/tyranny/communism/anarchy in their country, obviously you wouldn't want that immigrant acquiring citizenship then voting for those same things they supposedly fled from. There's nothing "racist" or "white supremacist" about that. That's just something everyone on all sides of the political spectrum wants. If you support right-wing policies, left-wing policies, progressive policies, authoritarian policies, libertarian policies... whatever, you'll want those policies to actually get passed, not for them to be voted against by people who recently moved to your area. The phrase "don't California my Texas" doesn't mean anything racist or white supremacist. It just means, if you flee any state in America because of bad policies, and move to a state with better policies, don't ruin that new state you're going to by voting for the same bad policies you fled from in your old state. These are what Tucker Carlson was referring to, not "the great replacement of white people" that the aforementioned shooters were referring to. The El Paso shooter was against all immigrants, legal and illegal, no matter what policies those immigrants would end up voting for. Tucker Carlson was only concerned with people escaping to America from awful policies in their countries only for them to then vote for those same policies and against America's interests. Tucker Carlson wasn't saying "don't replace white people with non-white people." Tucker Carlson was saying don't replace people who've voted (or will vote) for beneficial policies with people who'll vote for harmful and disastrous policies — policies that did nothing but ruin other countries.

# Gun Control

Next, you have those exploiting these shootings to push for more gun control. The problem is, more gun control is what these shooters wanted in response to their attacks. The ChristChurch shooter said in his manifesto that one of the reasons he carried out his attack was "to create conflict between the two ideologies within the United States on the ownership of firearms in order to further the social, cultural, political, and racial divide within the United States" and claimed that "This conflict over the 2nd amendment and the attempted removal of firearms rights will ultimately result in a civil war that will eventually balkanize the US along political, cultural and, most importantly, racial lines." He then claimed that this would "result in the racial separation of the people within the United States ensuring the future of the White race on the North American continent".

The Buffalo New York shooter said in his manifesto that New York's already-strict gun laws are what **convinced** him New York would be an easy target in the first place, saying, and I quote: "NY has heavy gun laws so it would ease me if I knew that any legally armed civilian was limited to 10 round magazines or cucked firearms."

He also said the "removal of gun rights" in America was "the plan all along," and yes, continuing to disarm Americans will only make it easier for future mass shooters to attack without fear of anyone shooting back.

Criminals target these kinds of areas for a reason. It's easy to commit a mass shooting when the people you're murdering can't shoot back. New York already had, like, the 4th or 5th or something strictest gun laws in America when this Buffalo New York shooting occurred. For more detail on how tedious and expensive it is to get a gun license in New York, here's a long but well-written post somebody else wrote on another subreddit explaining the process: [https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/s64m9b/how\_to\_buy\_a\_fucking\_firearm\_in\_new\_york\_fuck/](https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/s64m9b/how_to_buy_a_fucking_firearm_in_new_york_fuck/)

I apologize that the author of that post swears a lot, but basically, you need to be ready to cough up hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars, fill out and submit over a dozen different pages of various documentations, have multiple other people (who aren't your friends or family) write up letters vouching for you, and wait months for all of this to be approved by the county before you can get the license. This whole process will often take up to a year and a half, if not longer.

# Mental Health

I've seen quite a few people on this subreddit and on youtube/twitter suggest these shooters' "mental health problems"/"mental illnesses" contributed to these shootings.

>[the kid who killed those people in Buffalo had mental problems which the school and police were aware of for months](https://twitter.com/REDCO131/status/1526248464320843776)  
>  
>[What happened in Buffalo was terrible but we don’t have a gun problem in the USA.  We have a very serious mental illness problem.](https://twitter.com/GordoCDA/status/1525601543126278147)  
>  
>[The tragedy in Buffalo, NY is the result of mental illness, something we have ignored for 50 years!! In the 50’s and 60’s we had institutions for the mentally ill!!! We need to bring them back!!!](https://twitter.com/richard_duble/status/1526009658326110209)

>[Man, mental health is a real problem in this country. 18 year old kids out here recording themselves committing a mass shooting...](https://twitter.com/anems12/status/1525588095080484867)

You also have articles out there talking about how this Buffalo New York shooter was "referred for mental health evaluation and counseling" prior to this Buffalo New York shooting.

Many on twitter have already pointed this out, but, racism is **not** a mental illness. Racism is a belief — belief that groups of humans possess different behavioral traits corresponding to inherited attributes and can be divided based on the "superiority" of one race over another. It may also mean prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against other people because they are of a different race or ethnicity.

Racism can't in any way be tackled with "better mental health" or "counseling". Racism can't in any way be fixed by tossing the racist(s) in question into some asylum, or giving them pills/antibiotics making them take X amount a day with a sip of water to wash down. These racist beliefs need to be refuted once and for all. The people who attempted to refer the Buffalo New York shooter for counseling should've known that that would be a waste of time. They should've instead addressed and refuted his racist beliefs and explained through facts and logic why those beliefs and fears were wrong and irrational, but no, they chose to waste time with this "counseling" garbage that ended up doing nothing to help address these beliefs/fears so he wouldn't be as motivated as he was to carry out this shooting.

# Joe Biden's and Kamala Harris's Responses

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris wrote brief responses to this Buffalo New York event. I want to go over them starting with [Joe Biden's response](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/14/statement-by-president-biden-on-mass-shooting-in-buffalo-new-york/).

>We still need to learn more about the motivation for today’s shooting as law enforcement does its work, but we don’t need anything else to state a clear moral truth: A racially motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation.

Nope. The Buffalo New York shooter's manifesto explained his motives pretty clearly. I don't know what else is there Joe Biden's struggling "to learn more about".

>Hate must have no safe harbor. We must do everything in our power to end hate-fueled domestic terrorism.

Hate? No. Hate isn't the appropriate term for Joe Biden to use here. These shooters didn't do what they did out of hate. These shooters did what they did out of **fear** — fear that immigrants were out to completely "replace" white people... fear that if nothing was done about this, white people would somehow end up being "outnumbered" and "overwhelmed". The Buffalo New York shooter claims exactly this in the first 2 pages of his manifesto, saying, and I quote:

"White people are failing to reproduce, failing to create families, failing to have children. But despite this sub-replacement fertility rate, the population in the West is increasing rapidly. How is this possible? Mass immigration and the higher fertility rates of the immigrants themselves are causing this increase in population. We are experiencing an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders, legally. Invited by the state and corporate entities to replace the White people who have failed to reproduce, failed to create the cheap labor, failed to create new consumers and tax base that the corporations and states need to have to thrive. This crisis of mass immigration and sub-replacement fertility is an assault on the European people that, if not combated, will ultimately result in the complete racial and cultural replacement of the European people."

I'll explain what makes this fear so irrational since Joe Biden isn't bothering to. For now, here's [Kamala Harris's response](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/15/statement-by-vice-president-harris-on-mass-shooting-in-buffalo-new-york/).

>Law enforcement is proceeding with its investigation, but what is clear is that we are seeing an epidemic of hate across our country that has been evidenced by acts of violence and intolerance.  We must call it out and condemn it.

"Calling out" and "condemning" these shooters and their racism meant nothing to said shooters, means nothing to others like them, and will mean nothing to whoever may now end up feeling inspired to carry out similar future mass shootings. The ChristChurch New Zealand and Buffalo New York shooters in particular made it clear in their manifestos that they were well aware of their own racism and **did not care**. "Calling it all out" would've accomplished nothing and isn't helping here, while just "condemning" this stuff isn't enough. These 3 shooters remained convinced their actions were the right thing to do. "Calling out" and "condemning" these racist beliefs hasn't been (and isn't) helping, so we need to try something else which is to directly tackle and refute these beliefs/arguments and irrational fears these shooters used to try justifying their actions so others will be less likely to feel motived to try and replicate these shootings. Calling something out is **not** a rebuttal to that thing, and neither is condemning. An example of a real rebuttal would be showing through facts and logic why it's not true that white people are in any danger of being replaced. Kamala Harris "condemning" something is just her openly saying that that thing is wrong. It doesn't mean she's actually explaining or showing why or how that thing's wrong, or in this case, why these beliefs these shooters had are false and why those shooters' fears were irrational, which is what Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the rest of the mainstream media really should've been doing — addressing and refuting said irrational fears head-on with facts and logic.

The current white house press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, was, in [this press briefing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/05/16/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-may-16-2022/), asked to address this "incoming replacement of white people" these shooters were on about, but she was basically dodging the question and saying only that she's "continuing to call that stuff out" and whatnot.

>Q    And then, on a substantive note, this weekend’s attack in Buffalo — the shooter professed ideology, echoed in some ways the hate — the hateful rhetoric espoused by the Charlottesville white supremacist protesters almost five years ago that motivated the President to run for this office back then, as he’s often talked about.  
>  
>What more does the President believe he has to do and the country has to do to combat that sort of hatred?  
>  
>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So let me just say we still need to learn more about the motivation for the shooting as law enforcement do — does their work.

As you can see, like Joe Biden, she can't seem to figure out that all she needs to do to get "the motivation for the shooting" is read the first 2 pages of the killer's manifesto.

>Q    In that vein, there’s polling that shows one in three Americans believe in some element of “replacement theory.”  You just spoke in very broad brushstrokes there.  Are there specifics that this White House is willing to do, willing to take in order to stop this form of thinking from further seeping out of the fringe and into the mainstream?  
>  
>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, you know, we’re going to continue to call this out.  As we have talked about many times, the President, at every chance he’s had — when we’ve seen a violent attack like this that is — that is — as we, you know, say “with hatred and racially motivated” — he calls it out and calls it what it is. So, one thing I do want to touch on is, like, domestic terrorism a little bit, which kind of hopefully touches on your question.

You can see how she's asked if the white house can help stop these shooters' form of thinking from spreading further but she dodges the question.

Here's the rest of it:

>Q    But on this notion that immigrants and others are believed to be, by some, taking over and pushing white people out of positions of authority in this country, which is at the heart of so much of this terror that is being spewed online, does the White House believe these views are being amplified by Tucker Carlson?  
>  
>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, you know, like I said, we are still figuring out the motivation of all of this.  And we are very clear — look, you know, as you all know, watching what happened in Charlottesville was a major factor in the President deciding to run — right? — and back in 2017.  You know, many of those dark voices still exist today, and the President is — is determined, as he was back then.  And he is determined today to make sure that we fight back against those forces of hate and evil and of — and violence. So that’s what we’re going to keep doing.  That’s what we’re going to continue to call out. But we reject hatred and extremism ideologies.  
>  
>Q    But just in the interest of — I apologize.  In the interest of time — I know you’ve got to go —  
>  
>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  
>  
>Q    — but are there elected officials that this administration views as threatening in this way?  
>  
>MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, it’s the — what we’re going to continue to do — anyone — any one person — right? — doesn’t matter who they are, who spews this type of hate — hatred, we are going to — we’re going to call out.  We’re going to condemn that.  I’m not going to speak or call out any individual names.  I’m saying that this is something that we need to call out. And so this is what the President has been doing and will continue to do that.  You saw him say that in his statement over the weekend.  And that’s — you know, now he’s going to go to Buffalo and visit with the victims that were affected by this violence that we saw on Saturday.

That's all she has to say on the matter — that she and the rest of the white house will "just keep calling it out and condemning it" as if that's gonna help solve anything at this point, and she makes no effort to address any of the actual replacement theory stuff she was asked about.

# Addressing Some of These Killers' Arguments

So since no one in the white house is interested at this time in addressing and refuting the arguments these killers used to try justifying their actions, I'm stepping in and addressing and refuting some of them myself. I'll start with some of the El Paso Texas shooter's arguments in his manifesto and then move on to the more recent Buffalo New York shooter's argument in his manifesto.

>This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas. They are the instigators, not me. I am simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion.

Now, I had to do some research on Texas's history since I had no knowledge about it, but from what I've found, Hispanics have been occupying Texas since the 1500s — over 500 years now. The first known Hispanic to discover Texas was Alonso Álvarez de Pineda, and he first went there in 1519 not to "invade" the place but to create a map of the area. He left the place immediately afterwards never to return. Around that same year in the month of April, another Hispanic named Hernán Cortés led a group of conquistadors into Mexico to liberate it from the Aztec Empire that controlled Mexico at the time, in what is now known as the "Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire". After that, about 9 years later, another Hispanic named Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca was on a ship heading for Florida, but due to hurricanes, windstorms and overall terrible weather, he ended up way off course and crashed the boat on Galveston Island, an island nowadays considered a part of Texas. The boat was damaged in the process and ended up ruined beyond repair, leaving him stuck in Texas and unable to get to Florida. Most of his group ended up either dying of hunger/thirst (since their food and water supply ran out) or captured and enslaved by hostile native American tribes that were living in the area. Only him and 3 other members of his group remained at that point. He traveled and met friendlier native American tribes who gave him and his group food and water, and helped them get to Mexico City. From here he was finally able to acquire a new boat and sail back home.

The next known Hispanic to end up in Texas was Francisco Vázquez de Coronado y Luján, and he was only try to navigate through Texas to find a city called Cibola that he was told was full of wealth.

After that, another Hispanic named "René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle" also ended up in Texas by accident when, in 1685, he was trying to get to the Mississippi River to set up a colony there, but, due to inaccurate maps and overall poor navigation, ended up reaching and colonizing Texas instead. This colony didn't last long (it lasted just 4 years) as it was repeatedly targeted and eventually wiped out by a combination of pirates and hostile natives.

In the 1710s, Hispanics established San Antonio (the first Hispanic settlement in Texas) to stop France from taking Texas for itself, as France had already taken Louisiana, a state located right next to Texas. In 1803, however, the United States (which didn't yet consist of all the 50 states we know of today) purchased Louisiana, and in 1810, the Mexican War of Independence started (due to Spain oppressing, mistreating, and enslaving much of Mexico's population) which lasted until 1821 and resulted in Mexico gaining independence from Spain. Around this time, settlers and immigrants from both the north and south of Texas went to live in Texas, increasing it's population.

In 1836, Texas (that was a part of Mexico this entire time) declared independence from Mexico, became it's own country and was renamed to the Republic of Texas. Finally, in 1845, the Republic of Texas was renamed back to Texas and annexed by the United States, becoming one of America's 50 states that we know of today.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas#History)

[https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/the-early-republic/age-of-jackson/a/annexing-texas](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/the-early-republic/age-of-jackson/a/annexing-texas)

[https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish\_conquest\_of\_the\_Aztec\_Empire](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire)

So that's it. That's currently the closest thing I found to a "Hispanic invasion of Texas" that ever happened in American history — an armed conflict that started and ended centuries ago that just so happened to involve the Hispanic country of Spain. This El Paso Texas shooter didn't seem to be aware of that and must've thought we didn't yet take back Texas from Spain or something. Also, there seems to be 2 different versions of the story about Hernán Cortés and the Aztec Empire. One interpretation is that Hernán Cortés was the aggressor and invaded the Aztec Empire in Mexico for their gold and other resources, and for glory. The other interpretation is that the Aztec Empire was oppressive and tyrannical towards it's citizens (such as collecting absurd amounts of money in taxes from them and offering many of them as "human sacrifices" for their "sun god") and Hernán Cortés was only trying to free them from this tyranny.

Other than that, I've seen no records of any real "Hispanic invasion of Texas". Other Hispanics came to Texas from time to time yes, but only either briefly (in the case of the guy who came in 1519 just to get a map of the place) or by accident (in the case of the explorers who ended up in Texas while trying to get to a different place). The ones that did come to truly occupy Texas were only guarding it from the French, but weren't needed anymore due to the United States purchasing Louisiana which those French were occupying, so Mexico fought for independence from Spain and achieved it. As far as I can tell, no one but the French were ever interested in "invading" the place this El Paso Texas shooter says the Hispanics have been invading, and even those French didn't ever truly attempt to invade the place as the United States bought off the land near it they were on.

>Due to the death of the baby boomers, the increasingly anti-immigrant rhetoric of the right and the ever increasing Hispanic population, America will soon become a one party-state. The Democrat party will own America and they know it. They have already begun the transition by pandering heavily to the Hispanic voting bloc in the 1st Democratic Debate. They intend to use open borders, free healthcare for illegals, citizenship and more to enact a political coup by importing and then legalizing millions of new voters. With policies like these, the Hispanic support for Democrats will likely become nearly unanimous in the future. The heavy Hispanic population in Texas will make us a Democrat stronghold.

I admit that this was something I was getting worried about myself, but right now it seems like the opposite is happening instead — A growing number of Hispanics/Latinos are showing to be leaning towards the right-wing/republican/conservative/libertarian parties more than before. [https://nypost.com/2021/01/23/why-the-us-hispanic-conservative-movement-is-surging-even-without-trump/](https://nypost.com/2021/01/23/why-the-us-hispanic-conservative-movement-is-surging-even-without-trump/)

[https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/opinions/republican-latino-voters-gest/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/opinions/republican-latino-voters-gest/index.html)

There's still a possibility this could change. Democrats may end up realizing that their current "open borders, free healthcare for illegals, and citizenship" stuff the El Paso shooter's been talking about isn't really working and decide to pile on more benefits for immigrants (at the taxpayers' expense) to increase the incentive for them all to vote Democrat and not for any other party. Who knows. Right now though, the last paragraph of that cnn article I just cited sums it up beautifully: "The United States is a healthier democracy when our political parties use ideas about policy to compete for the votes of **all racial, ethnic and religious groups** \-- not fearmongering, tropes and stereotypes about our fellow citizens. In the current partisan landscape, Democrats certainly need Latino votes to hold power. But if those voters defect, let's hope it's because Republicans are expanding the boundaries of our nation, not the boundaries of Whiteness."

>Remember that both Democrats and Republicans support immigration and work visas. Corporations need to keep replenishing the labor pool for both skilled and unskilled jobs to keep wages down. So Automation is a good thing as it will eliminate the need for new migrants to fill unskilled jobs. Jobs that Americans can’t survive on anyway. Automation can and would replace millions of low-skilled jobs if immigrants were deported. This source of competition for skilled labor from immigrants and visa holders around the world has made a very difficult situation even worse for natives as they compete in the skilled job market. To compete, people have to get better credentials by spending more time in college. It used to be that a high school degree was worth something. Now a bachelor’s degree is what’s recommended to be competitive in the job market. The cost of college degrees has exploded as their value has plummeted. This has led to a generation of indebted, overqualified students filling menial, low paying and unfulfilling jobs.

While I agree that "the cost of college degrees has exploded as their value has plummeted," this can't be blamed in any way on immigrants. This is the fault of our own government guaranteeing student loans to everyone without assessing how likely they'd be to pay it back. This incentivized colleges to raise their prices thanks to the extra free money and subsidies, while the colleges themselves contribute to the problem by introducing more and more useless/low-paying majors, and various classes unrelated to students' majors, both of which also drive up costs while decreasing the value of college degrees. Also, many colleges allow people from outside the country to attend in the form of online classes, so getting rid of immigrants would do nothing to help fix this problem as a person nowadays wouldn't even need to be in this country to attend a college in this country.

>The American lifestyle affords our citizens an incredible quality of life. However, our lifestyle is destroying the environment of our country. The decimation of the environment is creating a massive burden for future generations. Corporations are heading the destruction of our environment by shamelessly overharvesting resources. This has been a problem for decades. For example, this phenomenon is brilliantly portrayed in the decades old classic “The Lorax”. Water sheds around the country, especially in agricultural areas, are being depleted. Fresh water is being polluted from farming and oil drilling operations. Consumer culture is creating thousands of tons of unnecessary plastic waste and electronic waste, and recycling to help slow this down is almost non-existent. Urban sprawl creates inefficient cities which unnecessarily destroys millions of acres of land. We even use god knows how many trees worth of paper towels just wipe water off our hands. Everything I have seen and heard in my short life has led me to believe that the average American isn’t willing to change their lifestyle, even if the changes only cause a slight inconvenience. The government is unwilling to tackle these issues beyond empty promises since they are owned by corporations. Corporations that also like immigration because more people means a bigger market for their products. I just want to say that I love the people of this country, but god damn most of y’all are just too stubborn to change your lifestyle. So the next logical step is to decrease the number of people in America using resources. If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can become more sustainable.

There are multiple far better ways this resource management problem can be fixed that don't involve "getting rid" of anyone. Mainly, we should stop wasting the resources we do have. Take, for example, one of the resources today we all need to survive: Food. At least a quarter of the world's food goes to waste, for various reasons. [https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs](https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs)

We also have another major issue that contributes to resource waste: Planned obsolescence. This is when manufacturers design their products "planning" for them to be "obsolete" after a certain amount of time when those manufacturers could very easily design those products so they'd last much longer than that. When products expire so quickly, people have to purchase replacements, which require money, labor, and of course, resources, making planned obsolescence contribute greatly to the very resource waste these shooters complain about. Some companies go even further and intentionally take measures to make their products as difficult as possible for customers themselves to repair. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned\_obsolescence#Prevention\_of\_repairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence#Prevention_of_repairs)

Neither of these issues (planned obsolescence, and wasting over a quarter of the world's food) will in any way be alleviated by "getting rid" of anyone. With or without immigrants, Hispanics, or the so-called "Texas-invaders" (whatever you want to call them), food around the world will still be wasted in colossal amounts, while planned obsolescence will still, thanks to these corrupt companies, run wild.

# Addressing the Buffalo New York Shooter's Argument Used to try Justifying his Actions

>White people are failing to reproduce, failing to create families, failing to have children. But despite this sub-replacement fertility rate, the population in the West is increasing rapidly. How is this possible? Mass immigration and the higher fertility rates of the immigrants themselves are causing this increase in population. We are experiencing an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders, legally. Invited by the state and corporate entities to replace the White people who have failed to reproduce, failed to create the cheap labor, failed to create new consumers and tax base that the corporations and states need to have to thrive. This crisis of mass immigration and sub-replacement fertility is an assault on the European people that, if not combated, will ultimately result in the complete racial and cultural replacement of the European people.

This is the entire "theory" this Buffalo New York shooter, and also the ChristChurch New Zealand shooter, used to try justifying their respective attacks, and right away I notice 2 major flaws. The first is this Buffalo New York shooter's use of the word "replacement". To replace something is to get rid of it (if it hasn't been gotten rid of already) and put a new form of that thing in it's place. The immigrants (regardless of their race) who come here to America strictly for a better life and to better America have no interest in "replacing" people like me who were born here, and I never had nor will have any interest in "replacing" any race that was here before me. Just because one group of people happens to have a different birth rate than another group doesn't mean that higher birth rate group is looking to replace the lower birth rate one(s). Merely outnumbering something doesn't mean trying to replace that thing. The amount of healthy meals I eat exceeding the amount of snacks I eat doesn't mean I've replaced those snacks. They'll still be there that I'll occasionally enjoy. I just won't eat much of them since it's healthier to focus more on the healthy foods.

Instead of "replace," a more appropriate term would be "coexist". Those immigrants I just mentioned are only looking to peacefully coexist alongside whatever race is already here, and that can be done no matter which of them's got the higher/lower birth rate(s).

Besides, certain creatures such as rabbits, chickens, rodents, and bees all have far higher birth rates than humans, yet nobody seems to be concerned that those creatures might be out to replace humanity...

A real example of white replacement would be if the "replacers" in question were directly targeting and physically hunting down white people, driving them out the country, pushing for laws designed specifically to harm white people (similar to the Jim Crow laws that existed decades ago that explicitly targeted black people), and so on.

The second major flaw with this replacement narrative is that it's actually not entirely clear by how much the non-white birth rate exceeds the white birth rate, or even if the non-white birth rate does exceed the white birth rate to begin with. This source, for example, is saying that, in America throughout 2020, more white people were still being born than non-white people. [https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/births-by-raceethnicity/](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/births-by-raceethnicity/)

The Buffalo New York shooter cited (in his manifesto) these articles as his "proof" that non-white birth rates were exceeding white birth rates. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_sovereign\_states\_and\_dependencies\_by\_total\_fertility\_rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependencies_by_total_fertility_rate)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_past\_and\_projected\_future\_population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_future_population)

These articles, however, mention **nothing** about **any** race's birth rate, making it impossible for me to figure out how these articles managed to lead him to this "whites have low birth rates while non-whites have high birth rates" conclusion he drew up.

# Conclusion

If I wasn't being hindered by reddit's 40,000 character limit, I'd refute more of this shooter's arguments since he makes plenty more that I can (and very much want to) refute, but I'm running out of room so I must wrap this up. If others can refute some of the other arguments these shooters used to try justifying their actions, that'd be great.

The people in the white house and the mainstream media should be addressing and refuting at least some of the arguments these killers used to try justifying their crimes. I don't expect the white house and mainstream media to have all the answers to every one of those arguments, and I don't expect them to have all the facts and data to refute them all, but I'm sure they can refute at least **some** of them, especially the main ones like the supposed "white replacement" those shooters were on about. Trying to "condemn" and "call out" these shooters, and those who are now feeling inspired by them, won't do anything. These shooters either believed they were doing the right thing, or knew what they were doing was "wrong" but believed it would've been even "more wrong" to sit by and watch this imaginary "white replacement" unfold as if anyone was actually trying to replace white people. This fear that whites will be replaced needs to be quelled — quelled by refuting with facts and logic.

Some real efforts have already been made to refute some of these irrational beliefs and fears these shooters had. The Buffalo New York shooter (in his manifesto) cited various "studies" (that he claimed "proved" that black people have worse brains and whatnot than white people), many of which have already been retracted or taken down. The Department of Psychology at Western University wrote a public apology for the harm one of their racist employees' studies this shooter's manifesto cited caused. [https://psychology.uwo.ca/people/faculty/remembrance/rushton.html](https://psychology.uwo.ca/people/faculty/remembrance/rushton.html)

Now if you go to the page that used to contain the fake study in question, all it says now is "The Department of Psychology at Western University refutes and disavows the research of Philippe Rushton, and condemns the continued harm caused by it." [https://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/ravensiii.pdf](https://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/ravensiii.pdf)

This is amazing! This department is taking the step in the right direction, and leading by example, as it refutes some of these false studies these shooters rely on to justify their shootings. It's more of this refuting with facts and logic that we need to help keep future shooters from being motivated to replicate the actions of these ChristChurch New Zealand, El Paso Texas, and now Buffalo New York shooters.

Edit: In the comments, I've addressed several more of the Buffalo New York shooter's arguments he tried using to justify his actions: [https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/usrcc6/the_current_best_way_to_help_put_a_stop_to_these/i97wi69/](https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/usrcc6/the_current_best_way_to_help_put_a_stop_to_these/i97wi69/)

You seem to believe that the majority opinion of these shooters is that racism was their mental illness.  That just isn't the case (for most at least).  It's mental illness that lead to them being a mass shooter.  The racism made that killing targeted.  A lot of conspiracy theories have racist coloring to them, so lines can be blurred.

But I don't see a mainstream belief that racism is a mental illness that causes people to go on killing sprees.
Honestly "hate" is definitely a factor here. If you read the manifestos the shooters say they are not motivated by hate and instead paint themselves as rational everyman, which is BS. Their manifestos also contain a lot of grievances against entire demographics of people.

The shooter in Buffalo had one of the names of the victims of the Wisconsin vehicle related murders painted on his riffle, so in part this was retaliation in the shooters mind.

Which brings me to another point. This is a different type of hate than what many people are used to. It's tribal. Still it is hate. Both the NZ guy and the Buffalo guy talked extensively about "white birth rates" yet neither of them even seem to have attempted to actually have children, instead they opted for murder. There is some degree of "hate" there.
Honestly, I found your post a bit disturbing.  It is written in a moderate manner, but the inferences I take from it are not.  

In general, you don't make a compelling case for your argument.  I'm not clear why you focus only on Trump, Carlson, gun control and mental health, but let's examine your conclusion.  You take it as a fact that the shooters own explanation of their actions and motivations are truthful and accurate.  This is a very big (and likely invalid) assumption.  You state the shooters' motivations are irrational, but also that their actions could be prevented simply by using rational arguments to refute their views.  This is illogical.  Irrational views are not generally countered effectively through rational arguments (e.g. irrational phobias). 

Now let's look at Trump and Carlson.  Nether of them are responsible for any mass shootings.  However, they are responsible for their own language and its impact, and they have used rhetoric that is widely interpreted as driving fear of immigrants and concern at the loss of the white majority, which you state is the shooters' motivation for killing. Here's some quotes from Trump and Carlson on the topic  of immigration in the US: 

* "it's going to overwhelm our country, and change it completely and forever."
* "this flood could become a torrent"
* "This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!"
* "Latin American countries are changing election outcomes here by forcing demographic change on this country at a rate that American voters consistently say they don’t want"
* "When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best...They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists."
* "Maybe I don’t want to live in a country that looks nothing like the country I grew up in. Is that bigoted?”
* "It’s like an invasion. They have violently overrun the Mexican border"

Here's part of a statement from the ADL following a segment on Carlson's show: "Last night, in a segment on his program dealing with voting rights and allegations of voter disenfranchisement, Tucker Carlson disgustingly gave an impassioned defense of the white supremacist “great replacement theory, the hateful notion that the white race is in danger of being “replaced” by a rising tide of non-whites. It is a notion that fueled the hateful chants of “Jews will not replace us!” in Charlottesville in 2017. And it has lit the fuse in explosive hate crimes, most notably the hate-motivated mass shooting attacks in Pittsburgh, Poway and El Paso, as well as in Christchurch, New Zealand."

Your argument that those encouraging fear of the immigrants and the "great replacement theory" are not causing mass shootings does not make sense alongside your conclusions. If language used to refute fear of immigrants would prevent racist mass shootings, then language used to spread fear of immigrants must also encourage them. The language used by both Trump and Carlson is very much focused on fear of immigrants and fear of white Americans being overtaken by non white Americans, and is therefore likely a contributing factor to these killings according to your own thesis. 

To give some examples of further issue I have with your reasoning, there is no reason to believe that people guilty of racially motivated mass shootings would not commit mass shootings if their racism was addressed.  They might simply kill different groups of people for different reasons.  You argue that gun control laws are not a solution and imply they are instead a driver for mass shootings by providing shooter's with an undefended populace to attack, but this is not supported by any evidence.  You ignore the fact that US mass shooting rates are significantly higher than other developed nations.  You also ignore the fact that the lower rates of mass shootings in other developed nations also corresponds with significantly more effective and consistent gun control than in the US.  There has been one mass shooting per decade in my country where we have strict gun control.  The US averages about one per month.  It's also notable that there are higher rates of mass shootings in US states with looser gun control laws.

I think this post I a valiant effort, but theres also only so much good talking can do. As you said, their ideas are irrational. A rational person doesn't get to the point of shooting innocent people because of their race. Many of the ideas they hold are contradictory, but they still believe them. The easiest (and more tame one) I how Carlson promotes the idea that immigrants will end up supporting and voting for the very programs they're fleeing from. 

Talking and disproving these ideas can work, but it'll take A LOT of time depending on how much someone has engaged with the ideas. There's likely no easy fix to this, it's going to take a long cultural change and I cant think of many great ways to speed it up. 

Once again I think this post could be a great effort and could generate some good conversation, but unfortunately I don't think many potential high risk individuals are going to be in locations to hear messages like this.
OP, I don’t agree with everything you said, I don’t disagree with everything you said, but I simply want to say this is a well reasoned, well articulated, stance. Kudos on this. A+
Your "refutation" of White Replacement Theory is very very weak, and I don't think it would actually convince anyone who didn't already agree with your position. 

Using rabbits as a countrrpoint is just biazrre and wildly off base
> The El Paso shooter stated in his manifesto that his "opinions on automation, immigration, and the rest predate Trump and his campaign for president" meaning he was planning his attack (and had his reasons for planning it ready) long before Donald Trump even ran for president.

The gunman is 18 years old. Trump started running for president in 2015. The gunman would have been around 12 years old then. You really think he was planning to shoot up the store when he was still a kid?
Great read OP.  Not that I agree w everything you had to say.  

At this point I’ve responded to almost a dozen “active shooter” calls, most all of them false alarms or unfounded.  I don’t know the answer or how to stop these mass killings - they are, in fact, a statistical blip in all the murders and mayhem in this country.  America and modern society may have painted itself into this corner.  IDK.  I guess all I can do is what I’ve been doing.
> The current best way to help put a stop to these racially motivated mass shootings...is to address and refute the arguments these killers use to try justifying said shootings

> "we're gonna stop mass shootings with facts and logic!"

This is the most useless, head-in-the-clouds idea I've ever read.

No future mass shooter is gonna see a Reuters Fact-But-Actually-Opinion Check, believe it wholesale, and completely 180 their opinion.
So you're saying we have to refute these arguments without addressing the people who are making the arguments? That doesn't make any sense.
