Title: Brand wants to me to sign organic usage contract

Post:
A company I am an affiliate for wants me to sign this type of contract. They do gift me when they have new products to launch and I post about them (I mean I have to try it to promote it). I donâ€™t feel right signing this. Can anyone advise?

There is not enough info here. Usage of what organic content? They want control of your whole profile? They want to use your posts about their products? They want minimum amount of content? Social media contracts often specify details about organic and paid content. 
You'll need to add a lot more details to get any real advice, not sure what you are asking.
