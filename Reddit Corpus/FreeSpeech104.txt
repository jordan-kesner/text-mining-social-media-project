Title: Free Speech Advocates Are Often Hypocrites

Post:
From a [Reason article](https://reason.com/2023/11/20/free-speech-advocates-are-often-hypocrites-this-doesnt-make-the-cause-less-important/):

>Censorship has been getting more prevalent in the sciences, and it's driven heavily by scientists themselves. Those are the core findings in a [new paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2301642120) for the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences...*\[The authors\] found that the censorship—and self-censorship—is typically motivated by pro-social concerns, such as curbing misinformation or preventing harm to vulnerable populations.  
>  
>Many on the left view concerns about free speech and viewpoint diversity as [bad-faith attempts](https://objectivejournalism.org/2020/07/a-more-specific-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/) by privileged people to protect their privilege. According to this line of critique, straight white men were fine with exclusion and censorship until it started to affect people like themselves. Now that they find themselves on the receiving end of the stick, they're suddenly very righteous about open inquiry—at least insofar as it benefits them. Most still have little to say when leftists, anti-racists, queer scholars, and feminists find their freedoms under assault (as they [regularly do](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/political-firings-left-leaning-faculty/)). Conservatives who condemn DEI-based [political litmus tests](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hypocrisy-mandatory-diversity-statements/674611/) for hiring and promotion are often comfortable with [Fox News witch-hunts](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/academic-freedom-campus-craziness/) against left-leaning professors or [legislation that bans the teaching](https://www.propublica.org/article/desantis-critical-race-theory-florida-college-professors) of views *they* dislike...  
>  
>Many people are inconsistent in their support for open inquiry: They're not particularly concerned when views they oppose are censored but grow highly engaged when people and perspectives they support face suppression.

The author brings up a paradox of sorts when censorship is good-intentioned but selective for pro-social concerns (eg, hate speech laws or DEI bureaucracies):

>\[A\]cademic research and audits by media outlets and government agencies consistently find that measures to restrict hate speech online tend to disproportionately silence [racial](https://aclanthology.org/W19-3504/) and [ethnic](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1163/) minorities, [religious minorities](https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2022-bias-in-algorithms_en.pdf), [gender and sexual minorities](https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-hate-speech-policies-censor-marginalized-users/), [social justice activists](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms), and [political dissenters](https://theintercept.com/2021/10/12/facebook-secret-blacklist-dangerous/). Outcomes like these are not unusual outliers in otherwise beneficent and well-conceived systems. They are reflections of how censorial practices typically play out: They are almost invariably designed and enforced by people with power, and they are typically deployed against those with less power.

>Alternatively, consider attempts to purge institutions of non-left perspectives. In general, immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities [tend](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/viewpoint-diversity-transcends-politics/) to be more religious and more culturally conservative than whites. The same tends to be true of people of more modest socioeconomic backgrounds in comparison to social elites. When an institution inculcates an environment that is hostile to more "traditional" values and worldviews, it may do this in the name of diversity and inclusion, but it will often have the [perverse effect](https://www.interfaithamerica.org/article/injustice-in-a-world-without-villains/) of excluding, alienating, and/or creating a more precarious situation for those who are already underrepresented and marginalized in elite spaces.

Yep. My speech is protected and free because I’m right and just and yours is literally hate speech and you should be jailed because clearly you’re a bad faith terrorist. 

No one realizes the slippery slope they’re paving leads to everyone’s ruin. Counter ideas with conversation. Censorship and even just posting a source and saying “wrong” just makes people firmer in their convictions.
>\[A\]cademic research and audits by media outlets and government agencies consistently find that measures to restrict hate speech online tend to disproportionately silence racial and ethnic minorities, religious minorities, gender and sexual minorities, social justice activists, and political dissenters. 

That doesn't seem to be the case. If you want to say both sides make a case for censorship, fine, but this basically seems to be titled to one side of the political spectrum.
I don’t think free speech advocates are hypocrites as long as they don’t consider themselves absolutists and acknowledge that censorship can be a very good thing. 

Again, censorship is a tool. It can be used for good or for ill. Preventing pornography in schools is good. u/cojcoco banning me because my hair is better than his is bad.

While it is true, one thing that worries me about this statement is that you do not need 'research and audits' to know that placing the means to censor speech into the hands of the powerful is open to abuse.

When regulating speech, as with any conflict of interest, we should always be mindful of abuses which *might* occur in the future, not only those which are occurring now.

History has shown time and time again that despots censor, so we should restrict that power, even in the absence of evidence of abuse in the present moment.

> Censorship and even just posting a source and saying “wrong” just makes people firmer in their convictions.

That’s why I try not to insult people when I talk to them. They’ll button up and dig into their bunker of wrongness even deeper. “Kindness, gentleness and persuasion win where force fails.”
Yeah no one gets this. Be fucking civil and talk. Find common ground with your enemy. But we’re so fucking polarized that I bet half of Americans would consider my comment ridiculous. What a fucking joke timeline. Seems like Reddit threads require at least one insult per comment and I can’t say I’m not guilty of it, I know it’s best to turn the other cheek but god damn is that hard sometimes
>  “Kindness, gentleness and persuasion win where force fails.”

This is true where your correspondent is operating in good faith.  However, on the Internet, many people are present only to push an agenda, and it is easier to belittle and gaslight people who present only a reasonable face.

Arguments are won with rhetoric as much as logic, and limiting oneself to only one set of tools can place one at a disadvantage.
> Ha ha.

> No it isn't.

Frak off, bad hair man.

Edit: only good hair people get free speech.
