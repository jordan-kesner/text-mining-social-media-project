Title: CMV: All new immigrants to the US should verbally agree with and swear to defend each amendment in the bill of rights, plus a series of secular declarations in support of women's rights, division between church and state, etc, etc

Post:
I base this assertion on recent polling on the views of Muslims within the US/Europe/etc and in the Muslim world.  Ideally this process should be conducted via polygraph, even though it is not 100% accurate.  People could apply for a re-test.

For example:

[62%](http://www.webcitation.org/5xkMGAEvY) of British Muslims do not believe in the protection of free speech; Only 3% adopt a "consistently pro-freedom of speech line."

[62%](http://www.torontosun.com/2011/11/01/strong-support-for-shariah-in-canada) of Muslims in Canada support Islamic law.

According to an interpretation of this study, approximately [45%](http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) of Sharia supporters surveyed worldwide disagreed with the idea that Islamic law should apply only to Muslims.

A [survey](http://www.torontosun.com/2011/12/12/muslim-women-win) of Muslim women in Paris suburbs found that three-quarters of them wear their masks out of fear - including fear of violence.

[65%](http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4092/europe-islamic-fundamentalism) of Muslims in Europe say Sharia is more important than the law of the country they live in.

[Large majorities](http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) of Muslims favor Sharia.  Among those who do, stoning women for adultery is favored by 89% in Pakistanis, 85% in Afghanistan, 81% in Egypt, 67% in Jordan, ~50% in 'moderate' Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, 58% in Iraq, 44% in Tunisia, 29% in Turkey, and 26% in Russia.

Those favoring the death penalty for [apostasy](http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) (leaving the Islamic religion) include 86% in Egypt, 82% in Jordan, 42% in Iraq, 76% in Pakistan, 62% in Malaysia, 18% in moderate Indonesia, and more.

[1 in 3](http://muslimstatistics.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/survey-on-islam-in-austria-18-of-muslims-support-death-sentence-for-apostasy-21-9-oppose-democracy/) Muslims in Austria say it is not possible to be a European and a Muslim.  22% oppose democracy.

[1 in 3](http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/ShariaLawOrOneLawForAll.pdf) Muslims in the UK strongly agree that a wife should be forced to obey her husband's bidding.

[43%](http://rt.com/news/208387-austria-islam-kindergarten-muslim/) of Islamic teachers in Austria openly advocate Sharia law over democracy.

[Honor killing](http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) the woman for sex outside of marriage is favored over honor killing the man in almost every Islamic country.  Over half of Muslims surveyed believed that honor killings over sex were at least partially justified.

America and the West pride themselves on how free we are compared to other nations, but we don't seem very concerned that we may be largely expanding populations who disagree with fundamental human rights.  These numbers are indicative of a failed system of immigration and assimilation.

There's more to radical Islam than simply the threat of terrorism.  There absolutely is a clash of civilizations, and we have to come to terms with that and try to encourage secularization worldwide and especially at home more than ever today.

You don't have to agree with the laws of the country, you just have to follow them. 

I am a citizen, and I would never swear to defend, for example, the 2nd Amendment. 

Being a citizen does not mean you must be an advocate of everything the government of the united states is and stands for. 

Plenty of people are strongly opposed to paying taxes. They still do it, but they wouldn't defend the practice, even though that's in the Constitution. 

It's unreasonable to try and force people to beleive exactly the same thing as a condition of citizenship, especially when it's not something that even natural born citizesn are inclined to do.
People who will obey this law don't need all these oaths. They will obey the law regardless.

People who will break the law would not really care about the oath. They would just say the words, and then go about their law-breaking business.

So why bother?

You can't fix broken attitudes by simply requiring an oath.  Instead you need to provide new immigrants with guidance, education, and cultural integration resources.  But that is, unfortunately, not as easy as requiring an oath. Sorry, there are no quick fixes for this problem.

We also pride ourselves on diversity of viewpoints. Immigrants do not make up even close to enough of a portion of the population to shift public policy alone; even if 10 million muslims immigrated, all of whom supported islamic law and every single one of which got the power to vote and voted, they wouldn't even be CLOSE to getting sharia law through. If they did get it through? It would mean that a huge number of people already here supported it. We should not fight ideas we disagree with with exclusion; we should educate ignorant people, not turn our backs on them. Stalin famously banned "the grapes of wrath" because he didn't want people to see that even the poorest americans could afford a car. He was afraid, and rightly so, because he knew that exposure to outside ideas would destroy his system faster. Fearing exposure to outside ideas is a sign of weakness, not strength; fearing the safety of your ideas in the face of opposition means the idea cannot stand the test. You're proposed that we prove the superiority of our system by excluding everyone who disagrees; what kind of proof is that? Of course a group of people that all agree are going to do the same thing. But if we let in people who disagree, and persevere? If we show them the error of their ways? That's the real success story. The story of educating, not excluding.
These things you want for people to swear to apply to the government, not private citizens.  

Separation of church and state in the constitution is the responsibility of the government, not a restriction citizens are held to.  If I as a citizen want to vote for a person because he is of a particular religion, I am not prevented by the Constitution.  There is no point making a non-government employee swear this. 

Same with women's rights - I have to respect the law but if I make personal choices/decisions based on sex, I can.


The US government already requires this, and while the oath is not as granular as you seem to want, it does require swearing allegiance to the law and Constitution of the United States.  [Here's some information about the current oath.](https://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/naturalization-test/naturalization-oath-allegiance-united-states-america)

So when Christians want to teach creationism in science class, which is a violation of church and state, should we test them as well?

When GOP leaders pass hundreds of restrictions on abortion and the right of women to have access to reproductive health, do they get tested as well? 
I examined a similar list of data on an earlier post.  I'd picked one data point at random. Your second source comes from the MacDonald Laurier Institute:
62% of Muslims want Sharia in Canada (15% say make it mandatory)

Wow, that sounds scary. Now the actual study shows a much more nuanced truth.

True, only 22% said Canadian law should "Make no space for the practice of Sharia Law", and 17% didn't know- and then those interpreting the data that you quote conclude that the other 61% support Sharia law.

But actually 47% agreed they should "Allow individual Muslims or Muslim families to choose to be ruled by Sharia courts in the case of divorce and other family matters if they want to"

8% agreed they should "Require Muslims to be ruled by Sharia courts on family matters"

And finally 7% said "Require Muslims to be ruled by Sharia courts on all matters"

So, note that NOWHERE does it say that non-Muslims should be under Sharia law.

It seems to me that if anyone should submit to a polygraph is the fear-mongerers who are twisting data to mislead people to the dangers of Muslims.
