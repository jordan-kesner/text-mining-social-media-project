Title: Big Tech's role in the ongoing "deprogramming" narrative

Post:
Remember when the "deprogramming MAGA voters" talk started? Well it's still around and "Big Tech" (except for, maybe, now X) seems to be playing a bigger role than ever.

Social media platforms are increasingly deciding what political content is "acceptable." It's not just about fact-checking anymore - it's about shaping entire narratives and only allowing certain viewpoints to be acceptable.

Are we seeing a new form of censorship emerge from all of this?

I think you're hearing the scary language that gets attached to what's ultimately just the march of progress, the change from barbarity to civilation over time. We don't really un-learn things. We don't forget that people believed the Earth was the center of the universe, but we didn't program their kids to think that. The deprogramming mostly happens generationally.
Legality aside, I feel we should still discuss trends in censorship from those in position to control discourse. As long as we are accurate about it.
This is incoherent. After making it clear you're politically on the  left (as am I), you launch straight into a defence of the apparently inviolate property rights of corporations. That seems a little strange.  You favor moderation, but then you explain that  while the government can't be in charge of monitoring speech the companies themselves shouldn't really be allowed to do it either. Well who, then?  Do you form your worldview by simply compiling reddit clich√©s, regardless of how uncomfortably they sit next to each other?
