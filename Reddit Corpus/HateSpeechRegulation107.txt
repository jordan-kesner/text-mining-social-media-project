Ted Cruz and Lindsay Graham were seen worshipping the Devil with Nancy Pelosi! Mitch McConnell also jacked off to a Smurf doll! You all know it to be true!

P.S. I am from Texas so I will sue you if this is deleted. Thank you for your time.
I'm so confused lol is this just showing that the law doesn't have any real teeth? Like I don't get what this actually demonstrates about the law other than it just shows the law is pointless?
Sounds like it's time to raid Truth with clowns, furry porn, duckface selfies, and hand holding.  They can't discriminate against any of it, right?
Greg Abbot is a little piss baby. The people who vote for him are either evil pricks or simpletons. Maybe a combination of the two.
