## Summary of Michael Shellenberger's Thread on CTIL Files

This thread by Michael Shellenberger focuses on the Cyber Threat Intelligence League (CTIL), a group that started as a "volunteer" initiative but later became involved in government censorship efforts. 

**Key points:**

* **CTIL's origins:** Founded in 2018 by individuals with military and intelligence backgrounds.
* **Activities:** Initially focused on cybersecurity, but later shifted towards "disinformation" and influencing public opinion.
* **Government involvement:** CTIL partnered with CISA and other government agencies in 2020.
* **Censorship methods:** CTIL proposed various methods to silence disfavored narratives, including "sock puppet accounts" and "law enforcement escalation."
* **Ultimate goal:** To integrate CTIL's framework and tactics into the government's counter-disinformation efforts.
* **Whistleblower:** A former CTIL member provided documents revealing the group's activities and government connections.
* **Public-private model:** CTIL's model of public-private partnership influenced the development of CISA's censorship programs.
* **Cognitive security:** CTIL promoted the concept of "cognitive security" as a justification for government censorship.
* **Misinfosec:** Terp and her colleagues created a censorship framework called AMITT and used it to influence the World Health Organization's strategy for countering anti-vaccination campaigns.
* **Timeline:** CTIL's activities pre-date the Twitter Files and Facebook Files, suggesting it played a crucial role in the formation of the Censorship Industrial Complex.

**Next steps:**

* Shellenberger and his team will present the CTIL files to Congress and make them public while protecting whistleblowers.
* Further investigation is needed into the origins of CTIL and its role in the Censorship Industrial Complex.

**Overall, this thread provides significant evidence of government involvement in censorship and raises concerns about the potential misuse of military tactics to influence public opinion.**

Summary by Google Bard
It's funny that they call themselves Disinfo group when all they do is censor truth and spread disinformation themselves.

If I read this message correctly, they are even bragging about making it easier to spread disinformation https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GAxnqU9aMAAbslp.png
Let me know when this rates mention in Wikipedia or somewhere else where stuff like that can reliably be kept track of. There's a reason we developed tools for keeping track of information, so when these things come back up in a year we can all be reminded that they didn't go anywhere. E.g.: the [Twitter Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files) were a huge hit in this sub when they were being trickled out for maximum engagement and penetration, but look at the aftermath.

This subreddit ostensibly about free speech gets treated like a clearinghouse for conspiracy theories, moderation policy gripes, and other low-quality bullshit that's inevitably censored when there becomes too much of it.
like all the other "conspiracy theories" that end up being true ?

are you paid to shill ?
