Title: The War for Conservatism

Post:
A hidden philosophical war has been brewing among conservatives for decades now. It became more apparent when Donald Trump won the nomination of the Republican Party for the Presidency, and it is now becoming clear which side has won. This is a war which dates back to well before our constitution was written and has been repeated throughout history with one side or the other gaining an advantage. First we have to identify the two sides, and then we have to point out why this is important. I don’t have good names for them, so I will call them “Traditionalists vs Classical Liberals”. You can dispute the accuracy of those names later, but I think it gets the idea across.

Traditionalists are opposed to change. They are nationalists (not necessarily a racist form). They are extremely religious and want that religion to be a part of their government. Among many other identifying factors, the most important is that they are opposed to “leftist ideologies”. This opposition is defining the Traditionalists like it never has before. This is important because Traditionalists don’t realize how much their opposition to “leftism” (I am being intentionally vague about that) is defining them. More on that later. It is important to point out these qualities because they are *definitional*. They separate Traditionalists from everyone else on the political spectrum. Traditionalists have many other beliefs, like the universal rights of all people, equality for everyone, the rights to free speech and protest and the freedom of the press among many others. But it is important to point out that those beliefs **do not define them**. I am sure many traditionalists will argue that fact, but it is very true and the entire point of this post.

Classical Liberals, within the conservative party, have many of the same features of Traditionalists, with the massive distinction that those features don’t define them. Classical Liberals are also opposed to change, but more in the sense that they are very slow to change. They don’t oppose change for change sake. Many of them, certainly not all or even a majority, are religious, but they maintain a far more strict separation of Church and State. They clearly oppose “leftism”, but they are not defined by that opposition. Again more on this later. What defines Classical Liberals within the conservative party is a dedication to the universal negative rights of everyone. A dedication to the rights of free speech, freedom of the press, 2nd amendment rights and many more. They view these rights as principles that cannot be violated. The constitution serves as their political bible, they will not deviate from it.

**Most conservatives reading this think that they are in both camps, but you are wrong.** In the past those lines were blurred. They were confused. They were confused because of the shared interest in each. The difference is in the emphasis on each of these ideas. For Traditionalists, they are defined by some ideas, and believe in others. While for classical liberals in conservatism, they are defined by the ideas that Traditionalists merely believe in, and they simply believe in the ideas that Traditionalists define themselves by. In today’s current political climate the lines are being clearly drawn, and they are being drawn by one man. President Donald Trump does not have the historical or philosophical chops to intentionally draw these lines, but he is doing so nonetheless. Traditionalists make up the vast support of Trump’s base (if not all of it) mostly on the basis of their desire to oppose “the left”. If you support President Donald Trump, you are almost definitely a Traditionalist. You may think you are a classical liberal, but you are not.

The reason you may think you are a classical liberal is because leaders of the conservative movement have blurred these lines. Men like Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Ted Cruz, Mark Levin, Ben Sasse, and Jeff Sessions have preached about our Founding Fathers and [First principles](https://www.glennbeck.com/2015/08/19/glenns-plan-to-restore-america-begins-with-first-principles/). They have defended our bill of rights and proclaimed themselves to be Constitutionalists. Because they were. They absolutely believe in those things as essential to their political identity. I know because I listened to them. I also believe in those ideals. They, among many others, taught me conservatism. I attended Limbaugh’s School of Conservative Studies. I listened to Beck attack Obama for increasing the power of the Executive and fight against universal healthcare. I watched Ted Cruz fight in congress to protect our borders. I was there, and I supported it.

But then something strange happened. Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the Presidency with the Republican party. I watched all those people shrug him off. Then I watched them start to panic and despair when Trump won. Then I watched something even stranger. They did an about face and reluctantly supported him because Hillary Clinton **absolutely could not win**. That reluctant support slowly turned into a half-hearted defense of the really stupid stuff being thrown at him (and I know there was some really stupid stuff), but the half-hearted defense was because “the left” couldn’t win. Then it became full-throated support to the point where it defines them. Traditionalists cannot let “the left” win. This is so essential to their political beliefs that it defines them beyond their beliefs in our universal negative rights and our constitution.

That definition of Traditionalists is what draws the battle lines in this war for Conservatism. It has taken me a while to get here, but it is the point of this post. If you are reading this and you support Donald Trump, you are sacrificing the basic principles of universal negative rights, separation of powers, federalism of the states, moral standards, and basic competence so that you can beat Joe Biden and “the left”. I cannot begin to describe how many of you I have talked to, and how many of you I have read that refuse to allow the pesky ideals of principles to get in your way in your opposition to “the left”.

If you haven’t guessed yet, I am a conservative classical liberal. I utterly oppose Donald Trump and his trampling of our constitution. I oppose his ineptitude with the powers he has been given and his attempt to secure powers he has not been given. I oppose his rejection of conservative principles, his intentional division of our nation, and his immoral ethical standards. This isn’t just because he doesn’t say nice things on twitter. This isn’t just a matter of saying one thing but doing another. He is accepting money from foreign diplomats in a knowledgeable and direct rejection of our constitution. He directed his staff to refuse a legal subpoena after a legal vote in the house to begin an impeachment inquiry on the unconstitutional stance of “absolute immunity". He has stopped international funds that were designated by congress and signed into law by the executive while ignoring the legally defined process by which to do so, so that he could hurt his primary political opponent. He has instituted a restriction of free speech under the guise of “fairness”. He has increased the division of this nation by taunting his political opponents, fomenting hatred, and provoking partisanship at every opportune moment. The list goes on.

I realize that many conservatives reading this will deny those obvious facts, but humor me for 30 seconds. **If you support Trump do me a favor and entertain the idea that those facts are true for 30 seconds.** That is all I ask. Just think about it for 30 seconds. It will stop a lot of needless debate. Because even if those things are true, you will still support him. Even if we spend the next few days debating the veracity of those facts, you will come back to the simple fact that you cannot let Joe Biden win in November. You will say, “the left” has ignored those principles too, why shouldn’t we play by their rules? You will say the agenda to take our guns, make abortion the law of the land, and the fundamental transformation towards socialist goals is something that absolutely cannot happen. You will say “the left cannot win”. And that will make you a Traditionalist. You are willing to abandon principle so that the left cannot win. That is the War. I know I cannot convince you to switch sides. I just want you to know which side you are actually on. I want you to know where the line is. Because you are not just fighting “the left” you are fighting against principle. You are fighting against our constitution, our Democratic Republic and against our values. You are on the wrong side of this war and you are winning the War for Conservatism, but you are losing the War for our Nation. But that is another long post.

Democrats fall in love, Republicans fall in line.

I am registered Republican, but ideologically I'm a libertarian. I'd fall under the "classical liberal" description you made. Both sides have an internal war going on. It could be summed up in many ways, but I think the key point is that the established Ds and Rs are attempting to hold onto their power, while the youths that supported Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders are attempting to take over each party. As they grow, they'll have more influence. My hope is that in a few more election cycles, the trend will move away from establishment Rs and Ds, and more towards libertarians versus progressives.
I think conservative opposition to Trump is well warranted (the Lincoln Project ads certainly seem persuasive to me), but I might disagree even with the idea that he "won" any ideological war. He won 45% of Republicans in the primary and then 46% of Americans in the general. He's not some giant change. A vast majority of Republicans support him but that is to be expected with Never Trumpers leaving the party and increased partisanship. I think we will continue to see Trump style populism on the right but his influence will drastically fall once he is out of power and Republicans return to the Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio types. Or maybe more specifically Nikki Haley, who is definitely going to be the Republican nominee in 2024.
I really appreciate this post. I am a liberal Democrat but I have no illusions what would happen if we didn't have a strong opposition party to check our worst excesses. The last few years of Trump has actually pushed me a little to the right concerning government power. 

While I think M4A in some form is inevitable I am concerned with how easily our institutions are corrupted by the current chief executive and wouldn't want supreme power over health care being wielded by someone as corrupt but more competent than Trump. 

There is a lot of reasons why the GOP fell to Trumpism but I think you nailed with your analysis of Negative Partisanship. It's just fear of the other party being in power. This sentiment is being fueled by non-stop right wing media over the last 25 years. It allows an before unheard of level of cognitive dissonance.  

Unfortunately this is occurring on the left as well as you see radicalized leftists that coalesced around the Bernie Sanders campaign and the DSA. They are being fed a daily dose of unreality and are proud of shedding principles of fairness, due process, and fair elections. Outlets like the Young Turks, the Intercept, Rose Twitter, etc..are building the same kind of structure that corrupted the GOP on the right. 

The center has to hold in this country. While I probably disagree with the OP on most policy issues somethings are more important than policy. Our country used to work this way. The opposition party would at the least try not to undermine the party in power and would hash  out differences in elections. We need to return to these principles.
Your definition of a classic liberal lines up rather heavily with libertarian beliefs. In the United States, there are loads of libertarians that align themselves with the Republican Party. The two party system we have makes this true because any deviation from one of the two ideologies almost assures a victory on the end of the other political spectrum. However, you insist on making note that if you end up saying, “Vote for Trump to keep Biden from winning,” insinuates you’re a traditionalist, I’d have to disagree. Given today many people lie firmly on opposite sides of the spectrum, you have to acknowledge at some point we are inherently stuck with two choices ideologically. As a libertarian, I vote republican because fiscal policy is most important to me within government, but I also feel that generationally the party is going through change. Many younger conservatives, like me, feel as though the constant social regulations undermine the fundemental conservative value of small government. Hopefully I’ll see this modernization and loosening of social policy within the Republican Party occur in my lifetime, but until then, we can’t vote for libertarian candidates because they don’t win. As much as we’d like to “make a statement,” it’s a wasted vote. We can’t vote for Biden because while he may be a moderate, he won’t oppose those radical sects of his own party. So yes, as a libertarian, we have to vote for Trump. If Biden wins, American economic policy may never recover from the massive overhaul the left would attempt to give it.
Can you rephrase the heart of your argument? I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at. Is your point that "Classic Liberals within the conservative party" must vote for Biden, or else they're not really Classic Liberals?

You have a lot of good info in there, but I think you are over-simplifying the positions and projecting certain beliefs onto groups of people who do not think that way. The cynical answer to politics recently has been that both the Dems and the GOP are fighting against the Constitution. There is no major party that's fighting FOR the constitution. And if that is the case, then much of what you say is irrelevant. 

You say that "what defines Classical Liberals within the conservative party is a dedication to the universal negative rights of everyone. A dedication to the rights of free speech, freedom of the press, 2nd amendment rights and many more." But I don't see how the Democratic Party aligns with those beliefs either.

And if that's true (and I'd love if you have evidence to the contrary), then voting for either party (let alone their candidates) requires compromising your beliefs in some way. So then the *real* question is: what beliefs are you willing to compromise on, and what beliefs will you hold firm?
"If you are reading this and you support Donald Trump, you are sacrificing the basic principles of universal negative rights, separation of powers, federalism of the states, moral standards, and basic competence so that you can beat Joe Biden and “the left”."

So become a never-Trumper because he is not pure, and support Mr. Biden? That will make the nation a better place (well, the previous nation; no borders will blur that line a bit)?

Is it possible to support personal responsibility, individual freedom, limited government, the sanctity of human life, rule of law, AND choose Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden? Apparently not, because that offends someone's sense of purity? Like it or not, a presidential election at this time is a binary choice. I haven't yet met a politician who has the exact same position as me on every single issue, so I must choose those who support the most important principles. Mr Biden isn't that politician.
I think that in many ways it's *because* the traditionalists feel like they're losing the "war for the nation" that they've been willing to break with the classical liberals.  Most people are aware at this point that [Christianity is in steep decline in the US](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/) and the Supreme Court decisions on gay marriage led many conservative Christians to feel like they're losing control of society.  

That's led to the whatever-it-takes-to-win mentality you described.
It's dubious at best to think that you have the ability to tell others exactly what their political beliefs are....and that you know they are wrong even if they don't.   


This isn't a political science post, this is a rant.
This is a really interesting description of what we have experienced in the era of Trump. When he first became a candidate, I really thought he had no chance precisely because he does not hold to the conservative principles that you mention. In the end, as you say, the party supported him and turned out in the election in spite of his weakness on principles because they could not let Clinton win. 

But I would counter with this: elections are a binary choice. Yes, you can always vote for a third party candidate who has no chance of victory, but, practically, one of two people will win an election. It is rare for any of us to have the opportunity to vote for a candidate that we absolutely agree with on every principle. Once we are at the ballot box, we vote for the candidate we feel is the better of the two. I don’t believe it is fair to judge that a voter has prioritized the defeat of an opponent over principles every time they make that practical, binary choice.
