Title: How would Social Media look if 1st Amendment Applied?

Post:
If all companies applied the 1st Amendment to Social Media, how would that look. And why aren't we heading in that direction? Is it the end of the world if some groups of people want to talk badly about other groups of people? Where is it said that we cannot group up and share ideas, opinions, even though they are really shitty? It's insane to try to control what humans talk about, it's barbaric honestly.

They do apply it by being private companies and not being limited by it. 
The market would be less diverse because businesses wouldn't control their content. Everything would be a shitstorm with minimal quality control.
We arent heading that direction because nobody wants to be voat or stormfronts new hangout. As a private organization they don't want the lawsuits, or the neo Nazi trash.
The first amendment is like a stick. When you pick up one end, the other end comes with it.

That said, the problem isn't that they silence whack job. The problem is they quash the voices of those who dissent. Sure, on the news, you see that they dumped the KKK or something like that. Behind the scenes, though, they're looking to quash the conservative voice. For example, why the hell do they ban videos from PragerU?
That's not what I'm getting at. I'm getting at having a platform where you know, humans are allowed to discuss what they want to? Is that such an extreme idea? Really?
The market would be less diverse if we allowed free speech on social media platforms. Well if that ain't the quote of the day, I don't know what is!

Really?

>They can go after your server hosting, like Microsoft did to Gab.ai by threatening to shut down their Azure services if they didn't remove two posts by a former congressional candidate.

>They have the ability to cut people and competing platforms off from access to the financial system, by booting people from payment processors like Stripe and PayPal.

>They can go after you at the DNS level, like what previously happened to The Daily Stormer and AltRight.com; the former of which was such an unprecedented escalation of the Democratic Party's censorship tactics, when it happened last year, that Ajit Pai (noted white supremacist of color) even saw fit to mention it in one of his white papers justifying the net neutrality repeal.

>They would not have to do this if there was already a public demand for more censorship on the censored platforms in the first place. Clearly, they are scared of competition. There is literally zero evidence that there is a public demand for corporations to have more control over what we're allowed to see, think and say.

>Heck, they have even escalated yet again in the past few months and started shutting down the bank accounts of individual dissidents.
