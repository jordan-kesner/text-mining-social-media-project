Title: How do I quit social media

Post:
At this point, I’m addictive to social media. I’m always on it 24/7. when im running or doing chores I check my instagram and tik tok  every 20 minutes and it’s annoying. Everytime im out I always have to post something and check every 30 minutes who saw my post. I hate it. I just wanna live aa private life and just off of social media at least four times a week. So I can focus on myself and my goals.

I deleted Instagram and Facebook years back. It took a few days to get used to not checking them. And now years later I do not regret the choice one bit. Life feels much better. It was bad for me and my mental health. It wasn't healthy for me. 
Do you have a laptop or desktop computer? Delete every app off your phone and only use social media on a computer. Make the accounts not remember you too so you have to login each time. I don't think social media is the problem, I think it's the 24/7 access we have to it. I used to love jumping in and out of Myspace and Youtube - but the key part was that I could jump off. If you quit 100%, you might miss parts of it or want to still have a way to reach out to people. This gives you a compromise.
hey! ik deleting apps is hard so i tried to this instead:

i deleted the apps and instead relied on chrome/any app browser to access my social medias instead!

so instead of having the availability of the social media as an app, i now have to manually search it in the browser.

I took off the "remember me" thing when logging in! so everytime I tried to use any socmed through the browser, I have to manually put in my acc deets to login.

Finally, I got bored and tired with all of those jazz and became bored of socmed in general, I deactivated my accounts! 

Everytime I find myself searching up any social media on the browser, I tell myself "eh, but it's deactivated" then move on lol.

Just to make it realistic, I'm still not really finished in quitting socmed given that I'm still using reddit and youtube. It's not an easy task to deattach yourself from social media but I hope you can find this advice helpful! 

goodluck op!!
