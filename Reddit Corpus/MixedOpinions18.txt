Title: CMV: There is no threat to free speech in Canada or the US, only the Government can ever pose a threat to free speech

Post:
I live in Canada, where the laws of free speech differ slightly than in the US, where we make exceptions for hate speech, but overall the concept of freedom of expression are largely present in both countries.  Despite living in Canada, us Canadians are highly sensitive to events in the US, so this CMV will be looking at both countries. 

I believe strongly in the right to free speech, I do not think a free society can fully function without that right.  Because of this, I take seriously claims that there exists a threat to freedom of speech.   Some examples of risks to freedom of speech I see pointed out:

- Journalists fired for voicing opinions
- speakers kicked uninvited from University Campus' for having controversial views
- people who wish to present what they consider valid criticisms are silenced by names such as racist and Islamophobe.  

- Recently a girl was grilled and condemned by her professor at a Canadian university for showing a debate from Jordan Peterson.  Only because she recorded the event was her professor forced to apologize due to public pressure.

I do not believe that any of those events have anything to do with freedom of speech, or represent any risk whatsoever.  In my view, the only way your freedom of speech can ever be at risk is either through violence, or though government intervention.  

In all these cases, no one's free speech has been removed, only platforms for them to use.  These represent examples of censorship, yes, but censorship is not the opposite of freedom of speech.

Let me pose an example.  I own a company, and I have salesperson.  The salesperson knows my product very well, knows how to sell it and is, for the most part, very social and agreeable.  However, every time he goes on a sales call he always allows his politics to slip into the conversation.  This causes a number of potential clients to back out as they suddenly feel uncomfortable.  As the owner of the company I tell the salesperson they are no longer allowed to bring up politics at all.  I am absolutely, 100% censoring my employee.  However, he still has freedom of speech.  He is, however, in a position where he must choose between exorcising his freedom of speech or keeping his job.  If his freedom of speech is more important to him, he can make that decision and quit his job.  His freedom of speech has not been removed.

And that's what this boils down to.  If you are willing, you are welcome to lose your job, your relationships (friends and family) if you want to choose your freedom of expression.  However, you never need to worry about losing your life, your freedom or your safety.

I do not believe that a University must allow for all voices to be heard.  If a professor of biology is teaching a class that evolution is false and creationism is correct, I think that biology professor should be fired.  If a physics professor teaches flat earth theory in a serious manner, they should be fired.  A university is a place where people are supposed to learn how to challenge ideas and argue, but it is also a place where they are supposed to learn about the overall consensus of academic literature.  

This is getting long, so I'm going to end it here.

Do you remember when Richard Spenser got punched in the face? This subreddit was totally packed with "CMV: Punching nazis is ok". 

This is a violation of free speech. If you are speaking at your own function, on your own platform, you don'y deserve to get punched in the face. Was what he said hurtful and wrong, yes, but if the speech falls under hate speech call the police. 

When people are saying that free speech is dying, they are referring to persons being punched, being assaulted, literally getting fire bombed for their views. 

When people jump past reason, past talking it out, past reasonableness, and go straight for either a fist or a molotov cocktail, you don't have freedom of speech. In this way, society can effectively revoke freedom of speech, without any government action. 
“Freedom of speech” shouldn’t be used here imo. The issue is that people are attempting to completely deplatform and attack ad hominem people who calmly and respectfully convey views that are offensive to some. 

A university should be a place where you challenge your views and use critical thought, not a place where you will have a shitstorm brought down upon you if you lean right. I’m very anti-censorship, and it makes me angry to see other left-leaning people chuck shit at people they disagree with instead of calmly debating their views. 

Many seem to be under the false impression that the debate surrounding “freedom of speech” is about the first amendment. It isn’t, it’s discussing the troubling sensitivity and close-mindedness of universities and students. 
Here's the problem with your view: you only see "freedom of speech" as a legal precept.

It's not.  "Freedom of speech" has the letter of the law, but also the spirit of the idea.  The United States was formed in part based on this idea that you can speak your mind and not have to worry.  We're in an era at present where that spirit is being violated regularly, and when the spirit of the idea is violated, it makes it easier to violate by law.

Canada is a great example of this, with their old human rights tribunals that put journalists in front of government boards to question articles written about topics they didn't approve of.  I worry that the no-platforming, the assault on speech in places like Twitter and Facebook, will make it more acceptable for regressives to limit speech in the public space from a legal standpoint.
In the case of the University issues, aren’t those state funded institutions, and thus fall under the government umbrella to which you are referring?

If a University (that is state funded) is censoring the speech of their employees, wouldn’t that count as government intervention?
Up until less than a year ago I held the opinion you state strongly, and often argued it. 

And I still believe that legally, free speech is protection from government. And the only laws threatening that is in Canada, under the banner of hate speech. 

The reason I changed was that I started to realise that the internet has changed how strongly non-government actors could be coordinated through shared ideologies. 

Now, since any private speech can be posted online, speech that does not conform to the dogma-of-the-day can be sanctioned far more severely non-governmentally than was previously possible. 

When a certain ideology use slurs like "racist and islamophobe" to attack people who criticise current dogma, they can impose a huge cost on the speaker without the need of help from government. They can shut down not only one speaker one place, but all speakers in all newspapers and universities. 

The methods for stamping out speech online is in online shame-mobs, and censors on internet platforms.

Before the internet, such private censorship had a local effect. Now they can be global. It is possible to enforce instant public and global punishment. This raises the stakes to saying what you actually think on a topic that touches on a current dogma, heavily incentivising people against voicing a critique.

The reason we have free speech protections is is for our species to error-correct ourself. We do this by encouraging everyone to think for themselves, and then tolerate them saying what they actually think. Tolerating new and dissenting views, is the criticism our ideas need to constantly improve and not stagnate. 

To succeed with this in the new internet age, we need to broaden the free speech to also include the use of coordinated ideological mobs and misuse of word-weapons to attack people. In essence we need to build a way to be civilised and tolerating dissenting views in a world where we are all connected online. 
1) All censorship is a threat to free speech. 

2) Universities are a part of the government. All education institutions are a part of the government as they are government funded, regulated, and often run. 
> In my view, the only way your freedom of speech can ever be at risk is either through violence, or though government intervention.

If you define abridgment of freedom of speech as only by violence or government intervention, then by definition you are correct. You are doing what everyone else does, defining FOS in a way that is convenient for you. Others say "hate speech is not free speech", defining freedom of speech in a way that is convenient for them.

No one wants to be seen as being anti-free speech, so they define it in a way that allows the speech they want to allow but suppresses the speech they want to suppress. Everybody does this. 

The truth is, everybody believes in suppressing certain kinds of speech. In your example, you clearly believe you should have the right to suppress the freedom of speech of your salesman, but have simply defined FOS to exclude that case. That way you can still say you are pro-free speech.

I disagree. Bill C16 in Canada can lead to imprisonment from improper speech. I can't explain it as well as this professor from UT. I would highly reccomend all of his videos - especially his debate on Bill C16 where he is backed up by lawyer in the court itself. 
his personal experience with the bill:

The government is nothing more than a powerful organization when you simplify it. There are other institutions that are powerful organizations as well. The government may be the only one that can make criminal laws, but they aren't the only organization with powerful influence on activities. If an organization with enough influence suppressed free speech, it would have a large impact, even if the government wasn't the one doing it. And plenty of organizations are large enough that if they wanted to, they could have a large impact. The government is merely supposed to uphold freedom of speech and itself not infringe upon it, but if any other organization of similar power did, it would still be attacking free speech. 
Isn’t it true in Canada that’s misidentifying someone’s made up gender can lead to jail time or a fine? How is that considered a hate crime?
