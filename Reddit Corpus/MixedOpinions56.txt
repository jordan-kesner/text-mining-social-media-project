Title: CMV: If you're really, honestly, unironically worried about a Communist/ Fascist Government in the near future, you should be pro 2A

Post:
FINAL EDIT FOR REAL: A significant portion of this thread doesn't directly address my point at all, and instead asserts without any real reason to believe so that the US Military is unbeatable no matter what. To address this, please see my new post regarding this issue so we can discuss it instead of distracting from my post here. BAD LINK CHECK IN 24 HOURS

I know both sides sling such accusations about both sides wanting an authoritarian dystopia in their respective flavours, but my opinion goes both ways. If anyone is legitimately worried about either Kamala starting WWIII and generating Hurricanes to destroy Republican states, or Trump rewriting the constitution to become America's first dictator, you should absolutely support 2A, even if you yourself aren't armed. Not everyone has the "stuff" to be willing to participate in an armed conflict against a theoretical oppressive regime, but even if you don't, there is no logical reason you should be actively opposed to the people that would be willing to do so having less and less weaponry.

A common argument is "no one needs machine guns", and this somehow coexists with "What are you going to do against the Army?", without considering maybe people should have access to machine guns TO fight against the Army. And if you're really worried about a hostile authoritarian regime being in the White House anytime soon, you should be pinning your hope on resistance and freedom fighters being armed to the teeth to fight back.

In my opinion, the lack of decisive pro 2A support either means a failure to appreciate the most fundamental rule of the world: "might makes right", an inherrant willingness to choose the evil government rule over violence, or (most likely), an understanding that the rhetoric of that evil empire government is just that, a rhetoric.

To CMV, please explain a logical line of thinking that allows a. "an unwillingness to allow citizens to be armed" and b "a legitimate fear of a dictatorial evil government coming to power" to coexist.

Another option that may CMV is a proposal of removing said evil government without resorting to armed resistance that is believable. Obviously you won't be voting them out of power, how will you remove Kamala's commie regime/ Hitler 2 without a fight?

Early AF edit, any claim that the government can't be defeated and will be in place forever is an auto fail to CMV. Source: Literally every armed resistance/ guerilla warfare campaign ever that succeeded.

Edit 2: Any argument using "You can't defeat the US Army by yourself is an auto fail to CMV. Fighting against the government entails a large armed resistance, not a one-man army.

Edit 3: anything that talks about the futility of armed resistance is an auto fail to CMV. This denies the success of every armed resistance and revolution in history, and is honestly such an insane take I have no words. To imagine that the US is somehow immune to the logistical issues that occur from combatting an armed resistance because the US military is "so strong" or "nukes" or "aircraft carriers" speaks to an underlying misunderstanding of military operations so fundamental that I simply lack the credentials to teach it all to you.

And this doesn't even address "it's worth fighting even if you might lose or die". If it's not worth fighting unless you are going to win, then it's not worth voting unless you're going to win either.

FINAL EDIT (Maybe): Thanks for everyone that replied, except those who ignored edits to continue to state a dead case. But with over 600 comments that rolled in at roughly 200 per hour, I simply can't reply to everyone and read everything! As a final note, as this thread slowly dies down, I'll do my best to respond to everyone that I can but you can expect a delay as I read  through everyone's comments!

As for the people that fail to understand why I put in prior edits; let me spell this out in the simplest terms imaginable, the notion that the US military could simply “handle” a widespread insurgency on American soil is staggeringly naive. Those who keep resurrecting this ridiculous idea lack a basic understanding of military logistics and deployment. Here’s a little-known fact (at least, apparently, for this crowd): the US military's logistical backbone is rooted *in* the US. A domestic insurgency is exponentially more perilous than a conflict on foreign soil for this reason alone. Think of this—US troops returning home would face a gauntlet of complications: bombed or blockaded ports, Air Force bases with eyes on them every second from locals, communications towers sabotaged, and recruitment stations reduced to rubble. If you believe the US military could somehow manage a war against Americans with the ease of handling a foreign adversary, you’re simply clueless about the nature of warfare. Frankly, nothing I could say would rescue you from such a depth of ignorance, so perhaps it’s time you embark on the long road to self-education.

I really like you're approach of tackling this from both hypothetical scenarios of a dictatorial left-wing government and dictatorial right-wing government, so I'm going to do the same in my response.

I think an essential observation from history is that dictatorships often, though not always, emerge from armed populace rebellions. I think we're all conditioned to look at WW2 era Germany, Russia, China, and Japan, as the rule of how dictatorships emerge, but these are the exceptions. For dictatorships that emerged from armed populace rebellions, Iran '78 comes to mind, so does Chile '73, and so does the country you hit when you throw a dart at a map of Africa. Or, if you want to go back a little further in time, The French Revolution. It was the armed public that put the dictatorship into power into power in the first place.

So, one must do a very careful balancing act when arming the public as a check against authoritarianism. It's not enough to have the armed public stand against the threat of emerging authoritarianism in the extant government, one must also have checks against the armed public's ability to install the authoritarian in themselves.

And we see this reflected in how limitations on the 2nd amendment are interpreted. All constitutional rights are, by definition, not without limitations. The 2nd amendment allows for private ownership of small arms, restricted ownership of heavy arms like explosive/destructive devices (e.g. RPGs, machine guns, etc...), and no ownership of strategic arms like cruise missiles, SAM sites, heavy cruisers, nuclear weapons, biological weapons, etc...

These weapons are the greatest check against the government going full fascist/authoritarian, but no one (red or blue) wants to live in a world where Elon Musk deploys the USS X, or Oprah deploys the USS Book Club, up the Potomac with the ship's guns pointed at Capital Hill.

To put it another way, it's not enough to have "my guys" armed against to prevent the "other guys" turning the government fascist -- the "other guys" don't want me to be sufficiently armed to turn the government into a fascist regime that they don't like, so, there must a **mutual unwillingness to allow citizens to be armed**, with the key question being "armed to what extent?"

A great example of this is the arming of the Black Panthers in the 60s (or might have been the 70s?). During the civil rights movement, untold numbers of black and minority voters were disenfranchised and intimidated at the polls, so Black Panthers started exercising their constitutional rights to carry weapons and patrol polling places in California to make black and minority voters feel safe from intimidation and persecution. It immediately led to sweeping gun control measures in California, and later, the Nation at large.

The fear from the conservative right was that, unchecked, this armed populace would lead to installing a dictatorial communist government. From the Black Panther perspective, they had the very definition of **"a** **legitimate fear of a dictatorial evil government coming to power",** because, that's the exact kind of government they had been living under since the end of the civil war... and it was only getting worse in response to civil rights political activism -- Jim Crow governance was dictatorial, and unquestionably evil.

Remember, dictatorships are the best style of government in picking strong winners and losers. So, in any budding dictatorship, there are members of the public willing to fight and die for the cause because they stand the most to gain... and in some cases, the most to lose if the other guys have their way.

And so that's why the 2A is fundamentally a double-edged sword. If you accept that an armed populace can be more powerful than a fully armed government with strategic weaponry, then you must accept that an armed populace can be equally powerful to install an authoritarian (communist, fascist, you name it) government in the first place.
So I agree with you. You go far enough left, you get your guns back. But I think you might be missing the point of leftist gun control advocates. Politicians can say whatever they like, but I think everybody knows that bans on... pretty much anything aren't happening. As a result, "gun control" is less about taking people's guns or restricting what they can have and more about things like competency exams, background checks, and safe storage. 

Those requirements would likely achieve many of the goals of gun control advocates without infringing upon, as the 2A people say, the rights of lawabiding citizens. For example, if you're required to keep your firearms locked up, the risk of your small child managing to shoot themselves with it goes down. Most mass shooters have a history of violence against women. No guns for proven domestic abusers is, I think, a measure most reasonable people could get behind. We require competency exams for driver's licenses, and I think everybody who's been to a range has watched somebody shoot and thought, "that guy should not have guns." 

All of these things are called out by GOA and NRA types as infringements on 2A freedoms, but they're all perfectly reasonable and appropriate, and really not restrictive at all. There's a sense that 2A rights are special and therefore any restriction is automatically unreasonable. This is, of course, not in keeping with the plain text of the 2A, nor is it in keeping with our understanding of other rights. The right to vote, for example, is often restricted from felons. Since the 2A is a kind of sacred cow in American jurisprudence, we often forget that basic limitations apply to most rights. 

And here's where people can go, oh well competency exams will just become the new literacy test for voting! My answer to that is simple: make the laws shall-issue and not may-issue regimes, and make them mandatory for all purchases. But honestly if we get to that point, well. It'll be a good thing we all have so many guns, and that we actually know how to use them.
Looking at history, I believe that statistically civilian weapons are more likely to be used to facilitate such a government than to oppose it.

If a fight like this happens it's NOT government vs citizenry; it's ALWAYS one faction of the citizenry vs another faction of the citizenry, and government.  It's never a dictatorship/authoritarian group without any other support, it's one that's supported by a large faction of the country.

Effectively fighting such foes depends on getting more people over to your side.  

If you're going to fight the military you're better off fighting with your hands than with guns.  The military are members of your own country, and they are generally (at least in decent places) loath to fire on their fellow citizens.  If you shoot at them they will shoot back, but if you only attack with fists they will stick to using anti-riot/crowd control tactics and equipment.
As someone who is conflicted on this.


Because the fascists are almost universally pro-gun (because they want to shoot the scapegoated people legally) I'm not going to talk about them.


Let's consider those on the left that want stricter restrictions on guns, and are worried about a fascist takeover.


1) MOST of the population, even in a fascist takeover, will be ambivalent as long as it doesn't affect them. How many Germans rebelled against Hitler? How many went along, kept their heads down, and tried to stay as uninvolved as possible? 


2) The fascists ALREADY have guns - in greater numbers than the communists. 


3) Most personal firearms are a joke compared to real military tech




To expand on (3). Look at Israel/Palestine. On one side, you have near-US levels of tech. On the other, you have an army with relatively primitive levels of technology (whether you consider them resistance fighters or terrorists)


Israel can choose a building, and it doesn't exist anymore. A missile, flying at incredible speeds, can go through a window, destroy a support beam, and the entire structure collapses. Basic communication devices - phones, pagers, walkie talkies, can be booby trapped with bombs on a whim.


And this is *Israel*. Not the United States, which is the REAL power house. If you have a machine gun? It doesn't matter. The person killing you is miles away comfortably sitting on a computer and commanding a bomb to be dropped atop you. Your home is not a bunker - it's not designed for combat.
Or you'll get flashbanged / smoked out. Your enemies will be in ballistic vests, with bulletproof shields, artillery, air support, etc.


Most importantly - the resistance would not control information. Look at how easily support for things like campus protests or just stop oil can be turned in favor of massive corporate entities using cherry picked news segments, broadcast everywhere. The resistance would be painted in the worst possible light, as awful terrorists trying to end democracy. And worst of all? Most people would believe it. They would rest easy at night, knowing the US Military is taking down these threats.


Until you can get a majority of the population to recognize their solidarity and similarities, any resistance will be crushed. And I'd you have that level of support - you already have the world. A single month of cross industry strikes would cripple the US economy beyond belief. 


Fighting is not the hard part - because the majority already have the power. It's getting that majority to recognize itself. Which is why mainstream news repeatedly tries to divide the population up into small isolated chunks of people.
Fascinating convo! Your points about guerrilla resistance throughout history are great. Many stories of underdogs prevailing.

But here's where I see a flaw: more guns don't necessarily mean more power. In a real uprising, Americans would likely split into different groups, each fighting for their own vision. The most organized groups (like fringe militias or hardline religious movements) would probably take an unbalanced lead in a conflict, while regular folks get sidelined. The military would either pick off each group systematically or the most organized of the rebel groups would seize control of the country.

I don't think anyone - left or right - wants any of these outcomes. I also think there are plenty of modern examples of peaceful revolutions leading to positive government reforms (ie India, South Africa, USSR, even the civil rights movement in the US).

Thanks for sparking such an interesting discussion! I'm curious u/Limp-Mastodon4600, where are you leaning now?
Here's the problem: the real threat of an authoritarian regime is that *a lot of people would like it* as long as it did things they support. Doesn't really matter how many people own guns if half of them are all in on Trump's dictator on day one, deport all the browns regime. With how polarized our media is, do you even think that many people would be swayed to the other side if their president started undermining the rule of law and the democratic process? Because, uh, Trump did during his term and he barely lost in 2020. So yeah, I'm not holding my breath that pro-2A freedom fighters would save democracy. I think they'd be more likely to be cheering for its death.
This is all a silly daydream, just like every hardcore second amendment gun lover with a fantasy of overthrowing the government. If an authoritarian government was voted in, the first sign that they are authoritarian is that they would try to dismantle the process that allows the president to be voted out of office after 4 years. How are guns going to stop that from happening? Once it happens, now you have an authoritarian government. Your guns didn't stop it. Game over. For the next 20 years they will slowly enact more and more laws that restrict personal freedom in ways that some citizens will love and some citizens will hate.

Something that most people with this fantasy don't think about is that Americans aren't going to unite against an authoritarian government that half of them voted in. It wouldn't be a revolution against the government. It would be civil war. But how do you have a civil war in swing states where the two sides are all interconnected with each other in every town and city and county? Even in solidly red and blue states, there's still a lot of people who have family members that support the opposite political party. Are they going to go to Thanksgiving dinner and shoot the enemy? Of course not.

Authoritarian governments don't go into everyone's homes and start torturing them. That would require a massive amount of human resources and accomplish nothing. They would pass laws in Washington DC to restrict the freedoms of different groups of people, one at a time. This would take years. The police would be the ones to arrest people for violating the law. When those people get arrested, the vast majority of the population would say they shouldn't have broken the law and they wouldn't have gotten arrested. How much of the non-Jewish population did Hitler have tortured and imprisoned? A negligible amount. No government wants their economy to collapse. 

And all of that ignores the fact that governments no longer need physical force to control people. The NSA has everyone secrets. They just have to threaten to expose someone's worst internet searches and content consumption to get them to fall in line. Close their bank accounts, shut off their cell phone, shut off their internet, and watch them run around ranting about it. No one's going to get violent over things like that. 

For these reasons and so many more, people who think their weapons are going to prevent an authoritarian government from taking over are a joke to people who take 30 seconds to realistically think these things through.
