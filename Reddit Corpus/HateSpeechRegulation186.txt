Facebook users will be changing their user pictures to some image related to this and then actively posting about how they won't use social media ... during the strike ...
Facebook should stop collecting user data and instead have a massive banner above the feed with a personal plea from Mark Zuckerberg asking for donations
The real solution is for everyone to get off of Facebook and Instagram. The next challenge is getting everyone off of Twitter. They’ll sell your user data soon if they aren’t already doing it. 

I don’t know what an end solution should be, because every company will end up selling user data at some point. It seems the only actual solution will legislation that prohibits selling user data, but that won’t happen for another 5 - 10 years by the way things are going. There will be a new major issue with technology within that time, and we’ll continually be behind the curve.
