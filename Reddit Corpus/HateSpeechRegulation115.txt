Facebook doesn't struggle with anything that they could fix by just throwing more money, which they have, at it. They struggle because they don't have by intention or incentive to fix this.
While everyone is distracted with a TikTok ban, Facebook doing circles around TikTok to be the shittiest company in the world. Zuckerberg is best friends with Peter Thiel, birds of a feather, they donâ€™t want to ban these groups.
But, but, how could this happen??! They fired all of the moderator teams and replaced them with automated AI running 24-7. Are the militia groups posting 26-8???
