Title: Free speech can’t flourish online — Social media is an outrage machine, not a forum for sharing ideas and getting at the truth

I don't think this is an online identity issue - I think this is an issue of the structure and purpose of the websites. the algorithm is the real problem bot here
years ago internet forums seemed much better. 

I think a **huge** part of the problem is the switch to upvote/downvote mechanics. Users love them but they're terrible for forums. 

With traditional forums, if you disagreed with something you had to reply and put into words your disagreement. If you couldn't put together a coherent argument then that hinted at what positions were well founded and which were not.

Now people just hit downvote, it lowers the quality of discussion because it's the equivalent of shouting "Boooo!" with no content... but it gradually pushes people out of communities over minor disagreements in doctrine and makes the community more and more toxic and insular.

it gradually selects for outrage over quality because it gives the majority of the power to the laziest readers.
It's hard to have anything resembling free speech on social media due to the algorithms, literally, manipulating you.  It shows you who, what, and where to hate because anger is addictive.  The more they give you an "enemy" to hate, the more you return for those skewed ads.  It is easy to manipulate large groups of people when you have thousands of pieces of information about them.  They know who you vote for, how that influences your diet, where you shop, what you buy, who you are attracted to, and when you wake up and go to bed.  Hate drives engagement, engagement drives ad clicks, and ad clicks drive profits.
