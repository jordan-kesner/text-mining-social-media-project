Title: Can Anyone Recommend a Truly Free Speech social Media Platform? 

Post:
I am on social media in attempts to locate victims of toxic exposure. I am trying to figure out what social media platform is likely to give me the greatest possible public visibility while withholding from breaking my first amendment rights.

Social media platforms are constitutionally forbidden from making any rules regarding speech that does not instigate violence. Social media platforms own computer algorithms. They cannot purchase, own or control first amendment rights. They are free to develop platforms that facilitate the right to free expression and even profit from it, but they are not allowed to fashion private rules that curtail it. 

I fear reddit may be as fast out as in. Another perfect example of abuse of power and systemic crime.

If you are talking about toxic chemical exposure, X would be good. If you are talking about toxic social exposure, stay on Raddit.
That’s just not true.  Privately owned social media platforms have no obligation to individual liberty.

That’s how corporate personhood works.

I don’t like it, but that’s the way it is.
