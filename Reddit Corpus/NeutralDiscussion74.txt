It's all just political theatre and grand standing because they aren't going to pass any meaningful regulation to enforce the safety features they want.
As they approve child workers, let children die on the border, take child tax credits, take free school meals, anything they can to make live shit but yes, social media is the reason these kids are feeling like shit. Definitely not the abyss of a world they’re looking into.
Senate and House haven’t done shit to protect children when it comes to guns. But go ahead and scold social media.
I love watching republican senators twist themselves into moralizing pretzels over social media and decry section 230 and the shield it provides companies that allow user generated content as they simultaneously strike down every democrat bill to remove the liability exemptions for fire arms manufacturers 
 
A gun is a tool, If someone commits a crime with a gun we punish the criminal that shot someone.... not the people that made the fire arm. 

Social media is a tool, If someone commits a crime on social media we punish the criminal... NOT THE PEOPLE OPERATING THE PLATFORM. 

this is not a difficult fucking concept to grasp.
You have blood on your hands says the US Senate which has neglected to pass any gun control, mental health or any other measures to address the number of school shootings. But yes, it's the tech companies who have blood on their hands. mhm.
