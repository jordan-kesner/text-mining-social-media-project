Title: Why are all my gaming video posts becoming spam?

Post:
I get why moderators would want to ban people looking for profits or whatever.  However, my youtube channel does not make profit I don't have a million subscribers or anything like that.  I just make these videos as a hobby and I like to share them around the internet.  It is original content, I am not reposting other people's videos.  I think some of my videos may actually have some value to them too, like my Skyrim First Impressions, or my Dungeon Defenders Review.  This may help people decide whether or not they want to buy the game.

I can't seem to post in any gaming sub Reddits anymore without going straight to spam.  I guess I am just looking for someone to explain the exact rules to me as I don't feel what I am doing if having a big enough impact on anything to have to be spammed 24/7.  But I am probably wrong and I am breaking rule #240828 of internet etiquette.  Just tell me what the big deal is.

The spam filter isn't perfect; I had to contact a mod recently to get a self post out of spam. If you're polite and explain why it isn't spam, most mods will unblock your submission.
