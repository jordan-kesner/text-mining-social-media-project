Title: CMV: It makes no sense that Democrats John Conyers and Al Franken were forced to resign while many (but of course, not all) Republicans still support Blake Farenthold, Roy Moore and Donald Trump, who aren't being cornered with the same zero-tolerance policy.

Post:
I'm not condoning Conyers or Franken. What they did is wrong, regardless of how great they were on the legislative front. Nevertheless, I don't understand how anyone -- regardless of their political leanings -- can support someone who clearly engaged in sexual misconduct.
&nbsp;

Trump, for example, infamously stated -- on tape -- that "You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. I just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything...Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything." On top of Trump being accused of sexually harassing women and making lewd comments about their appearances on record, Ivana Trump also accused the president of raping her. 
&nbsp;

Regarding Moore -- Yes, Moore lost the senate race last night, but he was never pressured enough to actually leave the race, as many (again, not all) Republicans supported him. And Moore has been accused of sexual harassing/assaulting several women. According to the New York Daily News, "A retired Alabama police officer said she was told to keep an eye on Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore back in the 1980s because he was known to harass teenage cheerleaders at local school ballgames...'We were also told to watch him at the ballgames and make sure that he didn’t hang around the cheerleaders,' Faye said. 'The rumor was that Roy Moore likes young girls,' she added. 'It was not only in our department but at the courthouse, too.'" 
&nbsp;

Republicans also seem split on whether Farenthold should resign, even though, according to the NYT, "He was sued over accusations of sexual harassment three years ago, paid out an $84,000 settlement, financed by taxpayers, and has an open Ethics Committee investigation into his behavior. Yet only a few Republicans have called for his resignation."
&nbsp;

It seems the only Republican forced to resign among sexual conduct allegations is Trent Franks. Is there something I'm missing? I'm genuinely confused.
&nbsp;

EDIT: First of all, thank you to everyone thus far who has commented and/or discussed this topic with me! I'm learning a lot from this conversation. One issue that's been frequently coming up is proof vs. allegation. A common argument that's been made is that Republicans require proof before relinquishing support, whereas Democrats do not. In Franken's case, there's a photograph of him groping a sleeping woman. The proof is there. But I wonder, if Franken were a Republican, would his party stop backing him? There's also the argument of allegation vs. conviction. While Farenthold wasn't convicted, he did settle a sexual harassment lawsuit with taxpayer money. Doesn't that, to at least SOME extent, factor into proof of the allegation? Someone mentioned that resigning is an admittance of guilt (like in both Conyer's and Franken's case). But isn't settling a lawsuit with money also an admittance of guilt?

I think this is a pretty significant misreading of the situation in Alabama.  The electorate down there is *staunchly* Republican and has been for a very long time.  Jeff Sessions, Moore's predecessor, was elected unopposed at least once.  They voted decisively for Trump in the last election.  It's likely that any half-way competent Republican with a pulse would have been able to win that district.  Moore lost anyway.

In our political system, there's only one way to force a person to resign: Oust them at the ballot box.  Moore was bull-headed enough to persist despite widespread calls *from Republicans* for him to exit the race.  I'm not sure what more you expect.

> It seems the only Republican forced to resign among sexual conduct allegations is Trent Franks. Is there something I'm missing?

Yes.  A whole bunch of other Republicans.

* Chris Lee resigned after emailing shirtless pictures of himself to women on Craigslist.
* Herman Cain abruptly exited the Presidential race in 2012 after allegations of sexual harassment surfaced.
* Vance McAllister was caught having an affair with a member of his staff.  Despite calls for his resignation (including from the Republican governor of his state), he chose to stay in office but pledged to not seek re-election.  He followed through on that pledge.
* Dennis Hassert admitted to sexually abusing young boys, although he had already been removed from his seat and was on the way to prison for an unrelated scandal.
* Tim Murphy resigned after having an extramarital affair.
* Joe Barton has been found sending nude photos to several  women.  This was only found out a couple weeks ago, and the news has been dominated by much higher profile scandals, so it's likely nobody even knows about this one yet.
The difference I observe here is:

The Democrat platform has moreso been the one espousing the values of zero-tolerance, shown by the emphasis on gender equality and bringing the issues of sexual harassment to the spotlight.

The Republican platform has not been doing so. They've rightly agreed with their opponents that No means No and all that, but it hasn't been a focus which they push on.

Therefore, when incidents and allegations of sexual harassment occur in the Democrat camp, it necessitates that the Democrats turn on themselves. When similar things occur in the Republican camp, the Republicans are far more willing to ignore it, because that wasnt their emphasis.

I'm not an American so what do I know though.
I don’t think you have a premise for an argument. There is no zero tolerance policy for Democrats.

Did no one know that Conyers was romping around his office in underwear for years? This policy also doesn’t seem to apply to Alcee Hastings. $225k was paid out because of allegations of sexual misconduct and he hasn’t resigned. It also hasn’t applied to Al Green, those allegations are disgusting. There’s also 30-40 current people in Congress have settlements that we don’t know about yet. We don’t know what the DNC will do if too many are Democrats caught up in this.

Edit: Also Bob Menendez has allegations of sleeping with child prostitutes in the Dominican Republic and was just on trial for fraud. No Democrats are asking this senator to resign.
Maybe I'm just jaded, but I don't think that Democrats care more about sexual misconduct than Republicans.  As recently as six months ago, Bill Clinton was defended fiercely...  by people flat out calling his accusers liars, to dismissing his known behavior as "just a blowjob" (conveniently leaving out "by a 22 year old intern that works for him in the oval office").  

This was calculated, political strategy. By pushing Franken and Conyers out, they get the moral high road.  This lets them campaign on this in 2018, *and* set up investigations into Trump himself if they win big in that election.

Conyers was more a symbolic move, he'd been in that seat for practically a lifetime, he's basically dead, and it wouldn't surprise me if his son gets it next.  Franken was collateral damage, and taking him out was part of a bigger plan to use this politically in the future. 
It's pretty simple i think.  A lot of repubs dont think allegations, especially allegations from decades ago, should necessarily derail a campaign or a person's life.  Obviously the facts matter.  You wont find a lot of republicans defending someone like cosby for example because of the scope and type of the allegations. But ass grabbing 30 years ago? come on.  Walking into a dressing room at a pageant trump literally owns?  Give me a break.  And so on.  It's the same thing colleges are struggling with across the country in Title IX cases - girl comes forward with allegation, campus immediately suspends and potentially ruins the life of a male student, then we figure out what actually happened down the road at some later time.  It seems that Dems are just more willing IMO to go off of bare accusations, my guess is because they depend on women voters moreso and the other minority groups, im not sure.  All of the partisan assholes painting republicans as a whole as not caring about women are idiotic and just ~~typical~~ radical democrat talking points in the fake news world.  
Nobody forced Franken to resign. In fact, he hasn't yet. He said he is going to resign "in the coming weeks", and I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up not resigning. 

Regarding Trump and Ivana and the rape accusation. She later retracted that. I'm not saying it didn't happen, but she did retract it, so...

The democrats will go "yeah, I'm sorry. Please forgive me", and liberals typically will let it slide...although Bill Clinton lied about all of it until he was impeached. Republicans will deny deny deny until the cows come home. Even when there is audio or video evidence of them doing the things they claim they despise. 

There are apologists on both sides to try and make excuses for people in their party. When the photo of Franken came out, all liberals did was say how it wasn't a big deal. I didn't really find the photo itself all that bad, but some of the other claims that were made against him were pretty bad. 

But you have to ask yourself this:
Why was this stuff ignored for so long? You see pictures of Hillary and Bill with Harvey Weinstein. EVERYONE in the world knew how he treated women for YEARS. It was an open secret. Yet Hillary and Bill sidled up to him to get money. Politicians really don't care about sex abuse. They are only acting outraged because it is politically expedient to do so. 


I think what we should take away from this is that ALL of washington DC is a cess pool of corruption and sex abuse. There is no one party that is worse than the other. They are both filled with morally bankrupt, vacuous dick heads that only care about money and power. Until people accept this, they'll continue to vote down party lines. They feel it's ok if "their side" does stuff. We just saw this with Alabama. People were actually willing to vote for Roy Moore KNOWING he's a friggin' perver/sexual predator because they'd rather vote for that than a democrat. 

When it comes to Al Franken it was pretty clear cut that he groped a women while she was asleep, I’m not sure any of the Republicans would stay around if they had a picture like that going around as well. 

Trump is a little different since his comments could at least in part be taken as facetious considering the setting. Though with the allegations maybe less so now. Overall Trump can be seen as minimizing sexual assault not really committing it until his accusations go through.

I’d say the main reason is image. The Democrats can’t attack Trump for his “grab them by the pussy” comments if Franken has a picture of “grab them by the tits”. The Republicans are in office and established so they can just say innocent until proven guilty. Democrats are looking to take over in the next election and need every angle to attack with. 
For transparency: I lean right, didn’t vote for trump, and would not have voted for Roy Moore if I lived in Alabama. I’m not familiar with Blake Farenthold, but I think I can at least comment on the rest

I don’t think you can totally ignore the politics at play of the situation. I think pressure on Franken and Conyers was less about the moral backbone of the democrats and more about gaining the moral high ground and a political advantage over the republicans. I didn’t seen widespread democratic pressure on Franken and Conyers to resign until after the republicans jumped on a landmine with both feet and threw their support back behind Moore. Conyers is a representative of a very blue constituency, and was already facing pressure to resign from the house judiciary committee due to allegations of his deteriorating mental health. Franken is a senator in a very blue state with a democratic governor. Both these seats would almost certainly be replaced by a democrat. The Alabama Senate seat would have only given the republicans a 51 seat majority, making it even harder to pass policy. Because they couldn’t really change their candidate and Moore refused to resign, they choose to (IMO wrongly) throw their support behind Moore, while the democrats were able to claim the moral high groups and frankly look a lot better than republicans without losing any significant political capital. 

I think the democrats did the right thing in pressuring them to resign, and the republicans were wrong to support Moore, but I don’t think you can say it wasn’t at least partially politically motivated
It makes perfect sense. Democrats and Republicans have two different bases. Democratic voters are more likely than Republicans to believe allegations of sexual misconduct. Thus there is greater pressure on Democrats to resign when allegations come out.
