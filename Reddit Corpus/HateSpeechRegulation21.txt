Title: Instagram’s CEO: Sends per impression matter the most on IG. How do you optimise for that? 

Post:

***Two challenges marketers face today:***

1. Gen-Z is spending more time watching stories on IG. How do we get their follow to make them watch stories?
2. Sends matter the most, but people share creators more than brands. Should we go more into influencer marketing or be the influencer?

***What Happened:***

Adam Mosseri featured on Colin and Samir’s Youtube Podcast, you should watch it if you haven’t. But stay with me for now, A quick rundown and analysis:

***What you should know:***

1. Instagram knows they thrive because of connections, not content. That’s why they have made their ‘Home’ feed too narrow and connections driven. The more connected an account is to your business through multiple connections and touch points, the more your chance of showing up increases.
   1. Mosseri’s example of his friend only making content for him is a great one. Showing how the industry will continue on the path toward a micro-influencers or accidental-influencers like Orlando Baby.
2. From the conversation, we somewhat learn Mosseri cares about creators and Instagram, but he can’t really turn Instagram into a creator haven. Because his vision doesn’t align 100% with Mark and others at Meta.
   1. Someone posted that clip of Mosseri talking about creator revenue sharing and he replied with the ‘ROI in that example is actually 0%... 🤦🏻‍♂️’. While this looks bad when said out loud, Mosseri’s explanation is the truth: Cr***eators are assets when they create content not eligible for monetization, liability when the platforms pay.***
      1. The platform also goes in negative ROI if they have to host a ton of content but the advertisers aren’t paying enough to be seen around that content. ***Ex:*** BeReal not getting enough brand investment, still they got the $500M Exit this week.
3. The blurring lines between original vs copied content: *Mosseri* and *Colin and Samir’s* views on adding a B-roll or new elements to make a piece of content original for algorithm sums up why it is so hard to win new audiences.
   1. Yes, It is original with some new additions. But like labels ask Online DJs on Twitch to pay them a cut. Original Creators should get credited if the piece of content being reshared by others is only slightly edited, or the creator should have the ability to ask for clear credits.
4. Even if you hate or love Instagram, You have to admire the decision making of Instagram’s leadership. Adam talks about the features they introduced over the years and how stories, videos and DMs helped IG remain relevant. The learnings are hidden in how they rolled out these features and integrated them.
   1. In 2024, while TikTok is at the centre of conversations and trends. ***IG’s feature ‘Add Yours’ is getting one step ahead of TT.*** As it is being used by Gen-Z with closed connections and local audiences. Maintaining IG’s need as a platform to connect with others.
      1. We can argue about IG’s war against political content but a lot of features they have now are also enabling people to speak on certain topics and events.
5. He’s totally right for blaming Google and Apple for kids using Instagram problem. They need to do better in terms of restricting access to IG from Play Store.
6. Mosseri goes over how TikTok algorithm is faster and kind of better at recommendations than Reels and YouTube.
   1. Logan Thorneloe also shared this learning in *Understanding Social Media Algorithms as a marketer*, TikTok is simply better at content recommendations than other platforms.

# What You Should Do: Getting More Shares & Follows for IG Stories

1. Optimizing for shares is hard, but focusing on this metric puts you into persona research mode. Spending more time on studying individual users should be part of your strategy.
   1. Learn from platforms that rely heavily on shares, X and Threads is an example. Start thinking about your reels as Tweets, what would get you a retweet aka Share? Remix the ‘Tweet and Reels’ Strategy.
   2. Focus more on content that invites people to participate like a ongoing joke or content show. As people like to invite others to get into what they are doing.
2. Maintain a specific theme/topic in your Instagram stories, with that you can make a clear pitch to your Gen-Z audiences. About why they should follow you for IG stories, alongside the regular content.
   1. It is annoying but something that Indian Sports pages have done for years is promote only the headline in the post. The complete coverage lives in IG Stories. ***Value in stories > post***
   2. **New Trend:** ‘Add Yours’ stickers are increasing stories engagement, you can use them to reach more of your audience. But don’t abuse the stickers everyone is using, better to start your own sticker chain and gain new followers.

Totally get what you're saying about optimizing for shares and getting Gen-Z to watch stories. It's tough when they’re all about those quick hits. I think focusing on themes in stories is key, like keeping it consistent so they know what to expect. 

Influencer marketing is definitely a smart move since people trust creators more. But yeah, it’s a balancing act. 

Also, have you checked out tools that help with engagement? There are some great ones out there that can automate comments and boost visibility. OpsAlien could be worth a look too, especially if you want to manage mentions across platforms without the hassle.
