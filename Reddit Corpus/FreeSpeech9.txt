remember how Trump was always called "Literally Hitler?"

Yeah, no, that's this administration.

Literally zero freedom of speech, cracking down on freedoms of Americans that are directly outlined in the Constitution.

They don't give a shit about what the Constitution says they can and cannot do. They'll do whatever they want.
When this precedent is set, what can theoretically be next? To those of other persuasions, how about when the pendulum shifts and someone is in power saying that if you express socialist opinions you are banned from several commonly used websites?

The possibilities for suppression are endless, and no matter who you are, if you value freedom of expression, basic human agency, this should be concerning to you
