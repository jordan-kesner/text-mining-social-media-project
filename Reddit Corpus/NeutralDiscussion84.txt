- HMAS Success is on scene and is attempting to locate the objects
- The objects were spotted in the search area about 2500 kilometres south-west of Perth by the RAAF Orion about 2.45pm (AEDT).
- The two objects – the first a grey or green circular object and the second an orange rectangular object.
- The objects identified by the RAAF Orion are separate to the objects reported by the Chinese Ilyushin IL- 76 to AMSA earlier today.

**9:30AM UTC / 5:30 PM MYT - PRESS CONFERENCE**

Attended by minister of transport, DCA chief & MAS CEO.

- Two orange objects approximately 1m in length and one white coloured drum were sighted by search aircraft, but remain unidentified and have not been conclusively linked to MH370.
- Chinese search plane reportedly sighted objects in the Australian search area. These objects are not in the vicinity of those which were identified by the Australian authorities last week.
- An Australian search aircraft had located two objects in the Australian search area, one circular and one rectangular.
- HMAS Success is in the vicinity and it is possible that the objects could be received within the next few hours, or by tomorrow morning at the latest.
- HMAS Success remains the only vessel in the search area.
- In the northern corridor, Turkmenistan have confirmed they have not had any sightings of MH370 on their radar.
- The most recent (satellite) images were obtained by French satellites, which captured radar images of potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor on 21st March.
- Police have interviewed more than a hundred people, including families of both the pilot and co-pilot.
- The technical committee is considering releasing the audio transcript.
- MH370 was carrying wooden pallets. However, there is no evidence that these are related to the wooden pallets reportedly sighted in the Australian search area.

Q&A

- Boeing & Rolls-Royce will be at PC to answer question from media, if required.
- SAR operation center will only be moved to Australia if the debris is confirmed to be from MH370.
- When probed on standard procedure are not being followed by the cockpit crew, MAS CEO deny the [report from Katmandu](http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/03/23/MAS-plane-ducks-nepal/) and clarify that it was the landing light, rather than the windshield was hit by the birds. The pilot did inform the ATC immediately and filed a report afterwards.
- On [MAS flight diverted to HKIA during a flight to Incheon, Korea] (http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/03/24/MH066-Divert-MAS/), it was a technical issue with the generator, rather than a safety issue. 
- No distress signal from the aircraft was picked up.
- Co-pilot was new to Boeing 777, previously moved from a lower fleet.

NASA says it will check archives of satellite data and use space-based assets such as the Earth-Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite and the ISERV camera on the International Space Station to scour for possible crash sites. The resolution of these images could be used to identify objects of about 98 feet (30 meters) or larger.

**3:20 AM UTC / 11:20 AM MYT**

The Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, who is currently in Papua New Guinea, gave a press conference a short time ago where he reiterated that there did appear to be a number of small objects that were visually identified. He said he learnt about the possible sightings late last night.

It is important to stress that at this stage the objects identified by the observers have still not been recovered, despite other vessels undertaking a more thorough search of the area.

**1:51 AM UTC / 9:51 AM MYT**

Australia’s Maritime Search Agency has just issued their 11th update for the search operation. 

- Continuing attempts to relocate debris spotted by one of their observers
- Search area has now been split into two zones, within the same proximity covering 59,000 square kilometres about 2500 kilometres south-west of Perth.
- The search area areas have been determined by drift modelling.

**12:45 AM UTC / 8:45 AM MYT**

Chinese research vessel MV Xue Long has joined the search area. Most recently it was involved in a rescue operation in December 2013 to free another ship, the Akademic Shokalskiy, which had become trapped in ice off the Antarctic coast. The Xue Long subsequently became trapped in ice itself and was assisted by a United States icebreaker.

**10:50 PM UTC / 6:50 AM MYT**

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he was told late last night a civilian aircraft had sighted a number of objects within the search zone. It is the first direct sighting of debris and follows two hits by satellite in the past week. He said the debris was: “A number of small objects, fairly close together within the Australian search zone, including a wooden pallet.” [Source](http://www.news.com.au/world/missing-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-search-resumes-after-chinese-satellites-spot-object-in-indian-ocean/story-fndir2ev-1226862354302)

Just how BIG & VAST is the current search area in the Southern Corridor of the Western Australian Coast? 

It has been often quoted in the Media that the mammoth task of finding any trace of MH370 is like “trying to find a needle in a haystack”. This is probably not the best analogy to describe just how vast and complicated the current search effort is so I will try to explain this in layman’s terms using the analogy of an Olympic Size Swimming Pool which most people can relate to.  My apologies to any US readers for the use of metric measurements, being an Aussie, I can’t relate to your Imperial system! I do not profess to be an expert at Maths either so any measurements and scales quoted below are simply approximations but should give you a general idea of the monumental task at hand! Anyway here goes I’ll give it a crack:-

The most recent reports have ‘narrowed down’ the search area in the Southern Corridor approximately 3,500 South West from Perth to an area of approximately 600,000 square kilometers, this area is slightly larger than the size of Spain. 

An Olympic Size Swimming Pool measures 25 x 50 meters or 1,250 sqm which is 12,500,000 square centimeters. The ‘narrowed’ search area is roughly 600,000 square kilometers and 1 square kilometer of this search area is equal to 20 square centimeters of the Pool or roughly a square of 4.5 x 4.5 centimeters in size which is about the diameter of a Golf Ball. 

Now to locate a piece of debris the size of 25 meters x 13 meters would be like trying to find the broken tip of a toothpick and to locate a wooden crate which measures 1.1 x 1.1 meters would be like trying to find a pinhead in an Olympic Size Pool. 

If you can imagine that search aircraft looking in the narrowed search area would be roughly equivalent to miniature mosquito's moving across the Pool less than 1 centimeter above the surface of the water and ‘spotters’ from this mosquito size aircraft can view a field area roughly 20 centimeters in all directions and are looking for a piece of debris the size of a broken toothpick tip ‘bobbing up and down’ in this field area which would be even smaller when viewed from above. These aircraft have less than 2-3 hours on a single mission to scout each potential area.

Ships scouting the area would be like miniature Lego man with an even smaller range of vision of than aircraft passing over. This search area which is known as the Roaring 40’s has some of roughest seas in the world with strong currents, strong Westerly winds and it is common to waves over 20 feet plus in height during bad weather. Strong currents, constant wave motion, sea foam, flotsam and jetsam would make the task even more difficult!! 

Now imagine the satellites that are passing over this area of 600,000 square kilometers, they would need to be over the right spot at the right time with clear visibility and no cloud cover to capture any object that may be bobbing up and down in the ocean. To scan and capture an area this size a Satellite would need to process roughly 30,000 images each with an area of 20 square kilometers in size so this might explain why the resolution is so low and time it takes to process. 

I am not sure what maximum resolutions are available but I read somewhere that the Chinese Gaofen 1 High Resolution Satellite can identify objects 1-2 meters in size. A single image which is roughly 20 square kilometers in size using the example above equals 20,000,000 square meters so that requires a massive amount of time and magnification to check and process a single image even with automated state of the art processing systems in place. 

Spare a thought for the search teams as this is an incredibly difficult and mammoth operation!!!

My latest theory - if you randomly pick an area of an ocean and take enough satellite images of it, eventually you will find "debris". 
According to abc 24 it has been confirmed that there were wooden pallets in mh370. Also noted that experts say any shipping pallets from ships would be in shipping containers, not floating freely. 
i have been following this story and these threads from day one. this story and these threads have take over my life and turned me into an internet addicted bum. 

i can however attest to this being the most comprehensive, consistent and reliable source of information assembled regarding the incident. 

well done /u/MrGandW and /u/de-facto-idiot. you have indeed set the bar high.
so if the pieces of the plane will most likely be smaller than 98ft(30m) why would this new NASA sat do any good? china detected stuff at a 72ft size, why are they better than this NASA sat?
I was really hoping someone would get their hands on a piece of the debris before the weather got exceptionally bad. Incredible that they're going to be out there in these conditions.
