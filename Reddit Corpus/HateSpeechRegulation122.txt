As a gay Chinese person, I can feel that China is getting more and more conservative towards LGBT community since Xi was the president, they banned so many LGBT tv shows on the websites that were able for people to watch in the past and now there is no shows and movies talk about LGBT, I can see the directors stop putting LGBT stuff in it to avoid the unnecessary problems, which is very sad because if people don’t see those pro-LGBT content, the majority people in China will never get a chance to know the LGBT community, and I’m afraid gay marriage won’t be legal here for a long time. Chinese government is very conservative and sensitive, but people here are much more open-minded than most westerners think, especially the young generations, no matter how hard China ban the stuff they don’t want people to see, young people will know what’s it like for gay people to live and marry legally in the countries like UK, US and Spain, because they can get more information and travel abroad more, I have already come out of the closet and many of my friends have no issue with that, they are all pretty supportive, the only problem is with those elder and middle age people, they can only get the news from those censored media that some of them don’t even know LGBT existed.
It goes further than that. They ban content about Tiananmen Square, Hong Kong, and Tibet. In Turkey, they ban pro-Kurdish content. They'll ban you for criticising the CCP.
One would think that with literally tens of millions of surplus men who have no hope of obtaining women, China would be more supportive of homosexuality.
