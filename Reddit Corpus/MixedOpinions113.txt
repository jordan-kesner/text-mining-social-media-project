Title: Biden calls for healing....HOW should we actually do it?

Post:
First ever post, moderate in both politics and tone (I think)! 

Opinions of US politics and political parties are at an all time low. Joe Biden has made a point of saying he wants to be the president of ALL Americans, but many conservatives/Republicans believe this is just a talking point and that he won't follow through (all too often, politicians that speak of compromise and bipartisanship really mean "the other party should do what we want and we won't give up anything").  Where do redditors see *actual common ground* where Joe Biden can make progress in the polarized political climate? I've been trying to think of some possibilities, and - while I wouldn't necessarily bet money on any of these actually working - here are some of the more plausible options I've come up with, interested to hear other ideas.

**Pass "catastrophic coverage for all"**

Healthcare is a big topic and Democrats want to see a Medicare for all option if not outright nationalized healthcare. Republicans don't like government control of anything, but they do like free markets. I think if Democrats make the case that emergency services don't follow free market principles (limited choices in insurance, no choices in what you receive leading to huge bills) and that people who don't/can't pay for emergency services are passing the costs onto others, we may as well distribute the costs for emergency services equally among everyone.

HOW IT FAILS: I think this will be painted as a Trojan horse/slippery slope leading to socialized medicine.

**Encourage better voting systems**

Now that half the country thinks elections are rigged and unfair (regardless of the merits of such beliefs), what better time to move to a better system? My personal choice would be approval voting where each political party can have two representatives on the ballot.   That way each party can have a moderate candidate and one that excites the base on the ballot without cannibalizing their own votes, and everyone (except Maine) can use the same ballots as we currently do and just change the tabulation process.  This leads to happier voters, better chances for moderate or third-party candidates instead of polarizing candidates, and a clearer picture of the true beliefs of the electorate.

HOW IT FAILS: The most obvious way is that states control their elections, not the federal government, so all that can be done is to provide an incentive in the form of federal funding to upgrade voting systems.  I'm also not sure Democrats and Republicans WANT to make things less polarized, and both parties realize that better voting systems threatens their hold on power by improving the odds that third party candidates will gain traction (ironically uniting them!).

**Green jobs in disadvantaged areas**

Republicans (especially Trump/populist Republicans) tend to win in rural areas that have less college degrees and less economic opportunity.  Democrats have explicitly said that they intend to eventually kill coal, oil, and natural gas jobs with only vague promises to provide retraining for folks in those industries (and you can imagine how much weight a politician's promise carries).  When you're threatening to take away someone's only hope for a middle class life, it's no wonder they hold a poor opinion of the party.  I think the Democrats should make the green jobs first, without any mention of the future of the CO2 industries (who knows, carbon sequestration or geoengineering may save those jobs in the future). To improve the energy grid, there are opportunities for energy storage in Appalachia and the Rocky Mountains by using abandoned mines and rail lines for compressed air or train energy storage. There's usually not much tree cover in low-income urban areas, maybe we can install solar panels on their rooftops and let the households receive profits from the energy production.

HOW IT FAILS: Republicans stance on climate change is skeptical (at best), and even if they believed that something should be done on climate change, they tend to believe that the government shouldn't be creating jobs. BUT, if the green jobs are targeted in Republican areas of the country (Appalachia), maybe the Democrats can get enough support to pass something.  BUT THEN race will enter the conversation as the government would be creating jobs in predominantly white areas of the country while reparations have never gotten real consideration in Congress, potentially losing support among Democrats.

**Ending affirmative action**

Ultra-liberal California just voted no on affirmative action policies for the second time in the state's history. I have known many people who "know someone that got turned down for a job because the company had to hire a minority because of affirmative action". I put that in quotes because I'm highly skeptical of the truth of it, but as a realist, the perception might be just as important. Martin Luther King Jr. said it best:

>“It is my opinion that many white workers whose economic condition is not too far removed from the economic condition of his black brother, will find it difficult to accept a ‘Negro Bill of Rights’ which seeks special consideration to the Negro in the context of unemployment, joblessness, etc. and does not take into sufficient account their plight (that of the white worker).”

I believe King's prediction has absolutely come true and explains much of Donald Trump's popularity and anti-woke sentiment.  

HOW IT FAILS: Even though this may end up boosting the general opinion of Democrats (possibly even among minorities), the fact that it can appear racist on the surface means I only see them doing this in exchange for a concession on something from Republicans. Perhaps it can be tied to creating the green jobs?

**Giving up ground on abortion**

I personally believe Roe v. Wade got things about right on abortion (roughly speaking: first trimester must be legal, second trimester regulated by the states, third trimester only to save the life of the mother), but that's *a personal belief*, and personal beliefs aren't supposed to be forced on everyone if there's reasonable debate about the belief (which I think there is on abortion, even if people don't always use reasonable debate when discussing it). Abortion is an extremely divisive issue that guarantees Evangelicals vote Republican and harms Democrats with other religious voters as well (such as seen with Hispanics in 2020). Joe Biden is a Catholic, perhaps he'd be willing to entertain formally enshrining the legality of first trimester abortion in exchange for giving state's the right to choose whatever they want after that.

HOW IT FAILS: This is by far the biggest longshot. I don't know if either side would agree to this, Republicans because it is too supportive, Democrats because it's too restrictive and they already feel that Roe v. Wade is secure (pretty understandably so). But hey, maybe?

So what are your thoughts? Is my belief that we can all go back to being proud Americans that don't demonize those with different views a pipe dream? Do you have better examples of true common ground between the parties that you would like to see explored?

You asked for ideas, here are a couple small wins.

The Trump administration wants hospitals to disclose their negotiated prices.  They tried to do it by regulatory rule.  The hospitals sued.  The Trump administration won the first round, but hospitals are appealing.

Biden can ask Congress to make the regulation law, eliminating the uncertainty regarding the court fight.   I can't see why the Dems would oppose this, and presumably the Rs would support it because it has Trump's name on it.

In a similar vein, Trump wanted to cap drug costs to Medicare using an "International Reference Pricing" concept. (The US wouldn't pay more than x% over the average paid by a basket of other countries.)

Again, I don't see why the Ds would oppose this, and the Rs have to recognize that it is a Trump initiative.  Trump wanted to do it by executive order, Congress could pass a law.

>Giving up ground on abortion

If the Dems are going to give when it comes to a wedge issue I say they would be better off giving up against furthering gun control. 

Change the debate and push for a better funded/executed enforcement system, sell the idea that "I dont need a gun that is breaking two laws at once, I need to have a system that takes the one that is illegal once off the streets"

In this case both sides can "win." New restrictions arent put in place which is a win for conservatives and doing more to better utilize our existing laws is a win for the Dems. 

I dont think that kind of compromise exists with abortion. Its a hell of a lot more black and white than gun control to most people.
Tackle low hanging fruit, like Stimulus bills and turn Americans hatred outwards. People love to rally to the flag, lets continue to villainize China, the parties have pretty similar positions when it comes to foreign policy so its easier to build consensus
As someone in a left wing urban bubble, the actions needed to heal are cultural, not political.

The left, broadly, is so openly hateful of the right and has such an iron grip on our cultural institutions (media, academia, pop culture) that I really don't even know where to begin, or what would even be possible. Like, "stop thinking your outgroup are evil people who must be crushed" is a good place to start, but how do you undo such deep-rooted feelings?

Furthermore, does the right even *want* to heal? I think they just want to give us the middle finger however they can, and I can't really say I blame them.
If Biden really wanted to do this he would call out the media for misrepresenting Trump for the last four years.

He would praise Trump for a handful of things he did that were good for the country.

He would talk about understanding the frustrations that Trump supporters have towards the establishment and he would make an honest effort to listen.

Lastly he would apologize himself for saying things like Trump called Nazis fine people and pop using misinformation to defeat him.  


Find a way to do these things and it would go a long long way to healing the country as a whole
> **Pass "catastrophic coverage for all"**

We did. It was called the Individual Mandate, and people hate it. The entire reason it exists is because we don't want people to skip out on buying insurance, getting admitted to the hospital for something terrible, and then sticking the rest of us with the bill.
>  Joe Biden is a Catholic, perhaps he'd be willing to entertain formally enshrining the legality of first trimester abortion in exchange for giving state's the right to choose whatever they want after that. 

I don't see how he could do that.  Roe said that no legislature, neither state or federal, can restrict abortion beyond the standards the SC specified.   The current SC is likely to accept more restrictions that earlier courts.  

I don't see where Biden has any negotiating room.
>**Ending affirmative action**

This is a bit nuanced.  In California, I doubt Democrats will attempt to push for a repeal on the ban again, because the downsides of pissing off Asian Americans exceeds any political upsides (some argue their narrow loss of two congress seats in Orange County may have not happened if not for this attempt).

That said, workspace racial considerations is pretty narrow at this point already in the US.

Overall though, there is a sense from CA, that people are willing to have race-concious policies, just not policies that explicitly define beneficiaries by race. (e.g. a university accepting top 7% of students from every high school is often race-concious as it is done to build racial diversity, but doesn't explicitly prefer candidates by race)
