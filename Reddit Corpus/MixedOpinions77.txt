Title: CMV: The current Chinese government is fascist and the antithesis of progress, and its actions are close to on par with nazi germany.

EDIT: You can probably guessed which post changed my view (hint: it’s the one with all the awards). The view I expressed in this post has changed, so please stop responding to it directly. Thank you to everyone (who was civilized and not rude) who responded. 



I live in the united states and grew up holding enlightenment values as a very important part of my life. I believe in the right of the people to rule themselfes and that every person, no matter their attributes, is entitled to the rights laid out in the bill of rights. I have been keeping up with the hong kong protests, and I watched john olivers episode on china which mentioned the ughers. I now see china, and the CCP, as not only fascist, but on par with nazi germany. It is unnaceptable to allow such a deplorable government to exist.  I consider their treatment of ughers as genocide, and their supression of hong kong as activily fighting free speech and democracy. While I disagree with trumps trade war, I do agree with the mindset of an anti-china foerign policy. With its supression of the people and its genocidal acts, I cant help but see china as the succesor to totalitarian nazi governments. Change my view, if you can.

EDIT: Alright please stop replying, my inbox is blowing up and I’ve spent the last 4 hours replying to your replies 
So please stop.
Thank you.

China's government is brutal, tyrannical, and typically zigs when the free world zags. I do not, however, see them launching continent-spanning invasions like the Germans did in WW2. I'd say that China is more analogous to USSR than Nazi Germany. 

Germany's expansion in the 30's-40's was inspired, at least initially, by a resentment towards the rest of Europe in the aftermath of WW1. The Nazi party seized the desperation of wanting something better in their citizens and exploited that to build a war machine. 

The USSR, on the other hand, was pragmatic in its power grab. When the war started, they had a NAP with the Nazis and were content to mop up the pieces of what was left. 

I see China as much the same. I don't believe that China's ambition is fueled by ideology as much as it is pragmatism. 

The human rights violations are not the goal, but a means to another goal in their eyes. There is no ideological fanaticism driving this...but a cold calculation of net gains/losses. For this reason, I see President Xi as more closely resembling Stalin than Hitler.

>While I disagree with trumps trade war, I do agree with the mindset of an anti-china foerign policy.

I'm curious as to how you would do this. China is well aware of how powerful they are and just who is able to stop them and who isn't. They are smart. They know that if the US asks them to "Stop doing x, y, and z" they are going to reply, more or less, with "Or what?"

No one besides the US and maybe a coalition of some others have the ability to answer that question in a way that causes China to pause. If War is off the table, then it has to be economics. A trade war does this, in a sense. What else would you suggest?
The first thing to address is your conception of freedom and human rights. For people from the global periphery (ie not part of the colonial, imperialist core), the most important freedom is the freedom to go to sleep with a full belly, walk in shoes, be free from violence, be free from the elements, and have the security to know that their children will have those freedoms also. [This speech by Fidel Castro puts it better than I can.](https://youtu.be/mHm7vTvf0sU)

If there’s one thing the CPC does really well, it’s fulfilling those basic needs. Before the CPC took power in 1949, China was carved up between major colonial powers, Britain was exporting opium throughout, it had been invaded by Imperial Japan, and poverty was rampant. Now China is the second largest economy, famines are unheard of, its former territory is almost entirely secured, and poverty has plummeted.  

Let’s revisit that last part. In 1981, not even 40 years ago, 88% of Chinese people lived in extreme poverty. [Now that’s down to 0.7%, with the government aiming to have eliminated poverty by the end of 2020](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/China-Expected-to-Have-Lifted-Over-10m-out-of-Poverty-in-2019-20191215-0008.html). To put that in perspective, if we don’t include China, [worldwide poverty has been increasing in both proportional and absolute terms.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/29/bill-gates-davos-global-poverty-infographic-neoliberal) If you’re questioning what that means in real terms, [here are some infographics detailing changes just in the last decade.](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2019-10-17/Graphics-Ending-China-s-poverty-by-2020-KREfWKGkIU/index.html)

Now let’s think a bit about democracy, and what that means. We could define it as a formalistic thing, where you have two major parties and the public votes between them two or three times per decade. The thing is, [no matter which party you vote for in America, you get the same policies and the same results.](https://medium.com/@andrewdobbs/no-voting-democrat-is-not-harm-reduction-8cda28633858) We’ve even seen studies outright call [America an oligarchy.](https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/21/americas-oligarchy-not-democracy-or-republic-unive/) If we look across the ‘free world’ we see the likes of Trump, Brexit, [rising fascism in Modi’s India](https://mobile.twitter.com/imMAK02/status/1209426278471745536?s=20), fascists surging across the EU, and the climate-denying PM of Australia running away to Hawaii while the country burns. 

We tend to be taught that the current form of western liberal democracy is an intrinsic good. However, if we put aside that Anglo-exceptionalism and look at the current outputs of China’s system and the western system, it becomes easier for us to see how people might actually find that system preferable.

In fact, there’s a lot about the Chinese system that doesn’t reach the mainstream. I’d encourage you to read [this piece in American Affairs analysing the high levels of regime support, interpersonal trust, political activism and government responsiveness in China.](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2018/02/surprise-authoritarian-resilience-china/) When you’re done with that, you should also read the section starting at [page 24 of this annual report on the CCP.](https://97da3d29-d157-40bc-9f03-6b6ab7c8dd7f.filesusr.com/ugd/183fcc_02a68a6947cd44e89b129af042d0c202.pdf) That section goes into the nature of recent democratic reforms in China, and the nature of democracy in China generally. The rest of the report is also worth reading. If you’re still hungry after that, [this PhD report goes into how the CCP monitors and responds to dissent. Warning: it’s a long one.](http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/48547/1/Hoffman%2C%20Samantha%20Student%20ID%204208393%20PHD%20THESIS%20Post%20Viva%20copy.pdf)

The situation in Xinjiang is a complex one, so I’ll take the remainder of this post to address it.

Approximately 50% of what you hear is outright propaganda, [as we know the CIA’s affiliates churn out](https://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0906/p25s02-cogn.html). We also see [CIA assets pushing narratives on Reddit](https://medium.com/@rsahthion/a-reddit-ama-claiming-to-be-a-uiyghur-quickly-exposes-a-cia-asset-slandering-china-1d667c098b77). The next 25% is [poorly researched speculation by an evangelical end-timer](https://thegrayzone.com/2019/12/21/china-detaining-millions-uyghurs-problems-claims-us-ngo-researcher/), and the final 25% is an accurate description of the PRC’s response to far right, religious terrorism and separatism.

First, [let’s just establish using safe, American sources that a bunch of Uyghur people went to fight with ISIS in Syria, then returned.](https://jamestown.org/program/returning-uighur-fighters-and-chinas-national-security-dilemma/) Let’s also establish that [there have been consistent terrorist attacks with significant casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_China) and that [the CIA and CIA front-groups have funded and stoked Islamic extremism across the world for geopolitical gain.](https://www.unz.com/article/uyghurs-political-islam-the-bri/) 

Now, we need to consider potential responses.

The CPC could give up and surrender Xinjiang to ISIS. This option condemns millions of people to living under a fundamentalist Islamic State, including many non-Muslims and non-extreme Muslims. This option creates a CIA-aligned state on the border, and jeopardises a key part of the Belt and Road initiative, which is designed to connect landlocked countries for development and geopolitical positioning. This option also threatens the CPC’s legitimacy, as keeping China together is a historical signifier of the Mandate of Heaven.

The next option is the American option. Drone strike, black-site, or otherwise liquidate anyone who could be associated with Islamic extremism. [Be liberal in doing so](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_al-Awlaki). [Make children fear blue skies because of drones](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/saddest-words-congresss-briefing-drone-strikes/354548/). When the orphaned young children grow up, do it all again. You can also throw a [literal man-made famine in there if you want](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_in_Yemen).

The final option is the Chinese option. Mass surveillance. Use AI to liberally target anyone who may be at risk of radicalisation for re-education. Teach them the lingua franca of China, Mandarin. Pump money into the region for development. When people finish their time in re-education, set them up with state jobs. Keep the surveillance up. Allow and even celebrate local religious customs, but make sure the leaders are on-side with the party.

Let’s take a moment to distinguish that last approach from that of Nazi Germany. Nazi Germany wanted to exterminate the undesirables. Initially it was internment in concentration camps with the outcome up in the air, with a vague hope of shipping them to Madagascar or Israel, but it later morphed into full extermination. All throughout, Nazi Germany was pushing strong rhetoric of antisemitism and stoking ethnic hatred in the public sphere.

There’s no evidence, including from leaked papers, that the goal of the deradicalisation programme is permanent internment or annihilation of Islam. [In fact, the leaked papers have Xi explicitly saying Islam should not be annihilated from China](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html):

>	Mr. Xi also told officials to not discriminate against Uighurs and to respect their right to worship. He warned against overreacting to natural friction between Uighurs and Han Chinese, the nation’s dominant ethnic group, and rejected proposals to try to eliminate Islam entirely in China.

>“In light of separatist and terrorist forces under the banner of Islam, some people have argued that Islam should be restricted or even eradicated,” he said during the Beijing conference. He called that view “biased, even wrong.”

As for permanent internment, we know from leaks that [the minimum duration of detention is one year — though accounts from ex-detainees suggest that some are released sooner](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/).

Unlike Nazi Germany, there’s no stoking of inter-ethnic hatred or elimination of a specific culture; [the CPC actively censors footage from terrorist attacks in China to avoid such an outcome](https://thediplomat.com/2016/01/chinas-comprehensive-counter-terrorism-law/). Xi doesn’t go on TV calling any ethnicity rapists or murderers. [Uighur culture is actively celebrated in the media](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-07/19/c_136455823.htm) and [via tourism](https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d414d336b7a4e34457a6333566d54/index.html). [Xinjiang has 24,400 mosques, one per 530 Muslims](http://pk.china-embassy.org/eng/zbgx/t1678846.htm). That’s [three mosques per capita more than their western peers.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=U3YBomwuB10&feature=youtu.be)

Could China’s approach be done better? Almost certainly. Is it the most humane response to extremism we’ve seen so far? That’s for you to decide.
China does have a very poor human rights record, but most of the crimes and alleged crimes that they are committing are without their borders and being done to their citizens. This is in contrast with Nazi Germany, which invaded several countries and engaged in human rights abuses in their populations. This is not a negligible difference when comparing the two countries, so I don't feel like it's fair to say that they're the same. While China is certainly looking to expand its sphere of influence and impact on global culture, I don't see how these objects are any different than what the US is already doing.







One thing that the US can do in the face of human rights violations is to provide sanctuary for fleeing people, including providing safe passage out of the abusive country, accepting more refugees, and fund programs to support these people. I don't see this happening under the current administration and Americans don't seem to have much compassion for people fleeing warzones and government persecution. Americans largely did not care to accept Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis, as it was not seen as out problem. Is there any reason to believe that Americans would feel any different towards fleeing Uighurs (who are mostly Muslim) than Guatemalans or Syrians?
I would just say that considering your opening statement, and also the fact that a John Oliver episode is primarily what you are basing your opinion on, you really need to study up a lot on Asian history, philosophy and politics before you attack something you know little about besides viewing it in your Western lens. On top of that, consider that America is trying hard to stir up a second Cold War and take that into account when viewing all the reports about what's going on in China.
Chinese treatment of Uyghurs better fits with Soviet treatment of Ukrainians in the 1930's and 1940's than it does with the Nazis, in my opinion. What would be more comparable to the Nazis in Chinese history would be the Dzhungar genocide in the 1700's under the Q'ing dynasty in which the Uyghurs partook.
Aside from your point:  

I've had a few too many internet arguments where John Oliver's statements misled me. He's an entertainer, not a reliable source of information. He's too selective in what he publishes and it harms accurate world view for his audience.
Well first you need to know what "fascist" actually means. Odds are you don't. I think what you actually mean is "authoritarian" and yes, it is authoritarian; it does not answer to populist demand, and governance is top-down, unlike in a representative government.

As for progress, the CCP is extremely progress-minded. You're loosely associating "progress" with "Westernization" or "liberalization" which is an ethnocentric view. Progress for Chinese involves development and social order. Hundreds of millions of peasants have moved out of dirt villages into cities with apartments, electricity, education, health care, internet, telecom, food availability, and general satisfaction of life after the end of the Maoist period.

Its actions aren't really comparable to Nazi Germany at all, actually. Censorship of speech, projecting power, a degree of nationalism, and some leninist reforms. That's about where it ends. No invasions, no pogroms (the persecution of Uyghurs is very complicated but not related to eradication or purity so much as cultural assimilation), a country built on the back of its own people with the consent of the governed.
