When you say "Shocking: IG was the most downloaded app in the last quarter" are you being sarcastic or was it actually shocking?

Thanks for these little updates! I appreciate them.
This is awesome. I'm currently only able to work part time because I am recovering from cancer and struggling to stay on top of the current wave of changes, this really helped me. ❤️
Sarcastically because everyone is always speaking on IG being low on engagement and growth. Calling it dead, but it isn’t.
