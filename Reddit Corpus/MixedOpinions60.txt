Title: CMV: If we as a society can fund libraries nationwide, we should also fund a free and open internet. And if that's too expensive, I think we should shift most of the funding from the most run down of libraries to a free and open internet.

Post:
**Edit:** Apparently there is some confusion: I'm saying that if society *can't* afford to fund both libraries and public access to internet, then it should prioritize public access to internet. That's not to say get rid of absolutely all libraries; which is why I wrote of an example of a library we shouldn't close (like the library of Congress). If society is able to fund both public libraries *and* a public access to internet, great! I'm not saying get rid of all libraries as many people seem to think I'm saying.

A library (such as the library of Congress for example), doesn't just store books. It is also used to secure and store culturally significant films and other such important artefacts. From this, it occurred to me, what better way to store these films and digital copies of books, etc on a free and open internet which society can easily access? 

The internet does everything a library can do and more. The only exception to this are physical documents which have culturally significant value. This is why I said "shift most of the funding" not all; and only if we can't fund both libraries and a free and open internet due to costs or something.

I want to make clear though: I'm not saying to completely get rid of all libraries, because there are some libraries of absolute significance, like the library of Congress. I'm just talking about already severely underfunded and failing libraries whose funds are being cut in a lot of states anyway. And from that gradually shifting focus from physical libraries to online "libraries".

Instead of allowing politicians to cut funding on these libraries and not give anything in return, why not push to have this funding redirected at a free and open internet where any citizen can access the internet, just like how right now, we give any member in society with a library card access to the knowledge in a library.

A library is supposed to preserve knowledge and culturally significant artefacts for the future. Well the internet can store all the printed information that libraries have and much more. It can also get the information to people much faster and to a larger audience.

I also understand how there are already organizations like [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) and [this online internet archive](https://archive.org/index.php) that already puts up free books or archival footage and such. But there are problems with that: firstly, it's funded by donation and secondly, it's only for stuff whose copyrights have expired. 

We also already have online courses on the internet like MOOCs and Kahn Academy and such.

It just makes so much sense that in 2015 or even this year, we recognize the internet as a useful educational tool. It can be used for entertainment too, but it certainly has educational benefits and to me it no longer makes sense that we focus  funding on physical libraries instead of the internet. 

Obviously, because traditional libraries bear significance to certain people just as printed books are preferred to digital copies by some individuals, it would be preferable if we funded both for the mean time. If not, I do think the funding should start to gradually shift from offline physical libraries to an open internet access for everyone.

I just see the physical artefacts that can't be stored in such online libraries being donated to publicly funded museums. Either that or we keep a small amount of offline physical libraries that secure these materials that can't be stored online.

But to be honest, either way, I already see this happening sometime near in the future. We just have to push to make it happen; and it's just whether it's earlier or later because it makes so much sense on so many different levels. 

I can discuss this a lot more, but I'll wait for the responses. If people have problems with this view, please CMV.

My local library *IS* the towns' public internet. Its actually really nice. I go up there sometimes just for a change of scenery while inter-netting. Its also the towns almost-free printers. Which saves me from buying a disposable printer every 6 months. 

And the library was the *only* post-sandy source of heat & electricity out side of Emergency Services. About a thousand people, sizable portion of our towns population, were constantly charging cell phones & warming their hands for like 48 hours. A wired refugee station with comfy couches. 

And its a great source of micro-fiche & other primary historical documents you wont find online. People make an actual living down at our state library, researching the micro-fiche stores for various topics. 

AND a daily meeting place for small groups who happen to want internet access. Books? Oh yeah - got 'em too. 

My point is that *all* modern libraries provide internet access. Its already a way of providing public internet - and like a zillion other things. 

You can lobby the FCC to be allowed to put up free wi-fi like Chicago tried to do. Or you can just spend like 1/1,000th of the money, spend it on a sure thing, and build a really awesome public library. 
I definitely think the answer is to do both, not to shift funding from libraries to free internet.

You are missing that libraries are a community institution as much as a storehouse for knowledge. I take my toddler to the library every week. I can and do read to him at home, but at his age he's just not as excited about sitting at a computer being read to from a screen as he is with going to story time, or being presented with brightly colored books of which he can actually turn the pages. I also see lots of people of all ages reading at the library. Some old person that wants to hang out around other people while reading his large print Louis Lamore isn't going to be well served by having free internet. The kids that flood into the library to hang out after school aren't going to get much out of free internet.

Physical libraries also have the advantage of not requiring a device to access. The last time I was at the library, a guy came in to use the phone. *The phone.*  If he doesn't have a phone, I'm guessing he doesn't have a computer either. Even in this day and age, there are people without the means to access the internet, or who have slow, crash-prone computers. It is far more useful for them to have libraries than a free internet.

Also, libraries have the benefit of having librarians. If I'm on the internet researching evolution, I might stumble on a fundamentalist christian site that refutes evolution entirely. If I go to a library, I can ask a librarian and she can point me toward a peer reviewed journal, or books that presents both arguments.

I'm certainly not saying free internet isn't a good idea. I'm guessing I could pay less in taxes for community funded internet than I do for my current access. The answer, in my mind, isn't to take the money from libraries, but to increase the cultural value of seeking knowledge and come up with funding for both.
Libraries are funded locally. Are you saying that when a poor local community has put its tax dollars toward their local library the Federal government should seize those dollars, close the library and say "use the internet." ?
One of the great things about libraries is that they are 100% free to use. This includes rentals of laptops or computer time. If you take this away in favor of free internet for everyone, people without access to a computer will be SOL. Granted, the number of such people is likely very small compared to the overall population, but these are also the people that are already getting the most benefit out of the existing library system. These are also likely to be the poorest of the poor in terms of modern society. If they don't have access to a computer or tablet at home, free internet isn't going to do them any good at all.   
  
The other thing is, oftentimes books are way easier to read than a page on the internet. If you're online then you are apt to be distracted by things like facebook or reddit. Theres no reddit in a book, thus you are able to concentrate much better on whats in front of you without having built in distractions.  By basically teaching kids that books are irrelevant and everything they need to know can be found on the internet you are contributing to an expansion of ADD culture, where kids can't concentrate on any one thing for more than a few minutes because they are constantly multitasking.
  
Finally, the amount of money already invested in libraries is fairly large. Just consider the number of books there are even in a small library. What are you going to do with all those books? You could sell them of course, but that would be an expensive process in itself and almost certainly wouldn't lead to a return on your investment. Since they are not failing in their purpose and they are still contributing to the public welfare, I see no reason for them to be shut down in favor of moar internets. 
I've noticed a lot of mentions of the Library of Congress in your original post. The problem with your analogy is, the operations undertaken by a specialized research library like the Library of Congress, or by national libraries in general, are extremely different from those undertaken by your average tax-supported public library. Modern public libraries aren't about *storage*; they're about *access*.

**Materials**

You mention a lot of "physical artefacts" of "culturally significant value." This kind of thing is mostly the purview of archives; it's not really of much concern to most public libraries. My library has a special local history collection maintained in cooperation with the county historical society. Aside from that collection, literally *everything else* is, to some degree, expendable. Which is not to say that losing it would be a good thing, but it could largely be replaced with sufficient time and money. In fact, hundreds or even thousands of books are removed from the library's collection each year due simply to age or lack of interest. Our smallest branches don't even keep anything for more than a few years. This should be especially obvious in the medical section, where failure to keep the collection current could literally get someone killed. Even in less critical areas, if a book doesn't get checked out for a decade, there's no reason to keep it cluttering up the shelves.

In short, "physical artefacts" are pretty low on the totem pole. The physical books themselves are not nearly as important as the information inside them.

**Space**

Space, on the other hand, has become far more important lately. There are very few spaces where people can go and socialize, study, conduct meetings, or simply hang out and not be pressured to buy some good or service. I don't go and hang out at Starbucks regularly because I can't afford an $8 pumpkin spice latte. I don't hang out at McDonald's or Wendy's because I can't afford to regularly buy a 1/4-pound value meal (plus, have you seen the bathrooms? \*shudder\*) I hang out at the library because I can go there and not risk getting kicked out because I don't want to buy something. This is especially important for adolescents. The local library is about the only public space in the entire county that doesn't hate them on sheer principle; library branches are just about the only place that teenagers can hang out without automatically being treated like a potential threat.

Plus, the public library is just about the only place where people of different socioeconomic backgrounds can expect to meet. I volunteer in a local library branch, and I regularly see immigrant widowed grandmothers arranging a visit back home, new parents seeking movies for their young children, middle and high school students escaping boredom, disabled patients and their caretakers with armfuls of books, and truckers looking for something to listen to on the road. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised to see the mayor in line behind a farmer making his weekly visit into town.

This is something the Internet can't really provide anymore. Dedicated blogs, forums, and chatrooms, and personalized search results provided by pretty much every search engine out there, have "gifted" every Internet user with a massive filter bubble that transforms confirmation bias from a logical failure into standard operating procedure. I highly doubt I would ever see those immigrant grandmothers or itinerant truckers in a random Internet chat. It'd probably be a bunch of college-aged liberal techno-hippies.

**Services** 

Even more important are many of the services that public libraries provide. Libraries have been providing services and programs for decades, like storytime for toddlers who are developing basic literacy skills, or informational programs on major new legislation, or monthly clubs for aspiring musicians, or publicly accessible computers, or direct deliveries to patrons who for whatever reason can't come to the library facilities themselves. You're not going to find very many of these programs or services on the Internet, and if you do, they're likely to be horrendously biased in some way.

And that's all assuming you can get on the Internet in the first place. I'm typing this on an old, cheap, broken laptop that I picked up on clearance for ~$400. That's nearly seven 8-hour workdays at minimum wage. If you can afford it on top of food, housing, water, and other basic necessities. Throw in a router, a modem, and a telecom contract that could easily match the price of the computer in a year, and Internet access is beyond the reach of many of the people who could most benefit from it. How much does a library card cost the end user? The first one's usually free, and replacements, if you ever need one, cost somewhere in the single digits.

Furthermore, these people likely don't own much in the way of taxable personal property, usually a car or a house. And the vast majority of public library funding come from — you guessed it — property taxes. The people who are served by these "severely underfunded […] libraries whose funds are being cut in a lot of states" are the people who most need the services provided by public libraries. It is these underfunded libraries, serving these underprivileged patrons, in these struggling neighborhoods, that are most need opportunities like [IMLS funding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Museum_and_Library_Services) and [Carnegie grants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Corporation_of_New_York).

----

There are certainly libraries out there that could be better spending their money. But the solution there is to replace the Board of Trustees or the library director, not the library itself. Public libraries offer services that can't be found anywhere else, regardless of one's socioeconomic status. They openly reject the proposition that one's worthiness to access the world's wisdom and culture is tied to the size of one's wallet.

By replacing some of the most crucial public libraries with the Internet, as you propose, we would be establishing a gated community of ideologically isolated echo chambers, creating a system of privilege and ignorance that is antithetical to the open, democratizing influence that both public libraries, and the Internet were created to be.
If you're shifting funding away from run-down libraries, you're just giving into the ["Starve the Beast"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast) strategy, where by under-funding a program, you cause it to suffer in quality, and then you use that diminished quality as justification for discontinuing the program.
Physical libraries absolutely benefit the public's access to the internet. The majority of libraries provide free wifi as well as free computers to the general public. Many people cannot afford internet or even a computer and the library is their only access to the internet. 

Libraries are also absolutely making to the shift to offering digital content. According the American Library Association, the number of libraries offering ebooks jumped from 9% in 2010 to 76% in 2012. Libraries are allowed to give out a finite number of digital copies to its patrons. 
Let's be more clear.  It's not a free internet, you want to have taxes pay for the internet.  All this does is shift the burden of the costs off the people that use the internet heavily and onto the people that don't use it or use it sparingly.  That seems patently unfair.

While it may make sense for the government to provide the internet infrastructure to ensure universal access to reasonably high speed internet, it should be paid for by user fees, with perhaps a small subsidy to keep internet affordable for low income folks.

Therefore, there is no need to dismantle the library system, particularly in the "rundown" areas, where the public library might be the only exposure a pre-school kid might have to books and reading.
