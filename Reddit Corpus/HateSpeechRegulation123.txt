Title: Introducing /r/inthenews - Opinion, Analysis, and Discussion of recent events

Post:
When I was recruited as an /r/news mod this winter, my focus was implementing the rules a little more seriously and consistently than previous mods typically did. In fact, complaining about lenient moderation is how I got the job. And as I gradually became the effective lead mod, I continued this policy.

One disappointment was that this often meant deleting articles that I thought were valuable and/or that the community strongly sanctioned. Or, alternatively, it meant letting non-news through. Often when someone asked the ~~penultimate~~ quintessential question "Where should I post this then?" I didn't have a great answer. I could find an *okay* answer, but i realized we don't really have a subreddit explicitly for opinion and analysis articles about all subjects that are in the news.

**And for that reason I have decided to create one. So I introduce to you - /r/inthenews: Opinion, Analysis, and Discussion of recent events.**

For all your...

- Editorials and other analytical articles providing the author's thoughts on news topics

- Posts about *your* opinion of recent events - or asking for the community's

- "Leaks"

- Videos and photo gallerys relating to recent events

Etc.

/r/inthenews is for anything you consider interesting that relates to recent, news-worthy events.

So please subscribe and start submitting stuff ASAP! Bring all your editorials! Bring everything you got pissed off over my deleting it!

As for /r/news, I won't go full authoritarian on content yet, but I do intend to use /r/inthenews as a way to continue to gradually bring /r/news closer to its literal purpose. 

Feel free to tell me what you think + ask any questions. I look forward to seeing what you do with this new subreddit. Welcome aboard!

Pre-emptive FAQ

**How is this different from /r/politics?**

It isn't only for politics. Bring your news about anything else as well.

**How is this different from /r/FoodForThought?**

It isn't only for long-form analytical essays. Photo galleries, short editorials, etc. are fine too. We will also try to focus on recent, news-worthy events. We won't be super-strict about this, but no essays about 19th century art please.

**How is this different from /r/AnythingGoesNews?**

While we have much more broad subject matter than /r/news and will be more leniently moderated, this subreddit isn't anti-moderation on principle and we may decide to introduce more specific rules in the future - so those who feel our moderation is oppressive can still feel free to go to /r/AnythingGoesNews for its independent rebellious goodness. /r/inthenews is also made specifically as an official partner to /r/news.

**Are "real news articles" allowed too?**

Yup.

**Why is there no rules and why is the description so short?**

We will develop the rules, description, etc. in more detail over the next week as we have time and see necessary. If you would like to provide input on this, we would be happy to hear it.
I think this is a really great idea. I often forget that /r/news isn't a default, so seeing stuff like this is really encouraging for me. Good luck!
Good idea!

You've just started so maybe this is early enough - it will have more impact if you name the subreddit so it lists around /r/news 

r/newsview

or something.

It's a great idea, but I fear that you're going to find that the people heading for /r/news will feel /r/inthenews is a little too 'diluted' or doesn't show up around the same place as /r/news and will just avoid it all together.

If I'm right the ideal would be a subreddit that somewhat mirrors /r/news but generated by reddit users opinions about what is happening, leaving /r/news just to do the news?

Anyway, good idea, those are my thoughts.

Hey, I'd misinterpreted your comment as a PM and responded in [that thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/yd8nd/alternatives_to_rnews_and_rworldnews_other_news/c648s39). Here's a ctrl-v of that comment:

>/r/news mod here. Got your PM but I figured I'd respond here.

>The subreddit you're looking for is: /r/news in a couple weeks once /r/inthenews picks up steam.

>The best thing you can do to help /r/news get where it needs to be faster is to post, comment and vote in /r/inthenews. People want to post where people will see it so activity breeds more activity. I am sure it will get there eventually given the header advertisement but the faster the better. Also report /r/news content that you think we may need to remove.
