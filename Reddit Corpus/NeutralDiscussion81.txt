We have also set up an email address for family members as a channel for them to communicate with us. Updates via the Malaysia Airlines website are also available.

Just got a text from a colleague covering it - 6 families just burst into the media briefing room - http://www.3news.co.nz/Families-storm-Malaysia-Airlines-briefing-room/tabid/417/articleID/336597/Default.aspx 

EDIT: I have seen video he shot. At least one woman was physically dragged from the room by authorities. It's on that link (can't direct link to it). Here is a still from it. http://cdn.3news.co.nz/3news/AM/2014/3/19/336597/malaysia.jpg

Since OP's aren't around for the presser, here:

All 26 nations have verbally agreed to assist the operation.

The normal flight path was flown up to waypoint Igari, there were no other waypoints programmed.

Maldives authorities have dismissed reports of a sighting in that area.

The criminal investigation into crew and passengers is continuing.

Some data was deleted from the pilot's flight simulator on Feb 3, forensic work is being done to try and retrieve it.

**While the presser is going on, authorities have removed the family members from the room they were being held in** - one of the older women has been knocked over. Authorities are holding back media from following at the bottom of an escalator, while the women try to communicate to them.

* **Update 1: 9:47am GMT:**

Outside the press conference, a woman thought to be a relative of a passenger has been knocked to the floor in scuffles.Sky News has been running dramatic pictures from what appears to be the lobby of the hotel where the press conference is taking place with a press scrum following the woman.
Police pushed the media out of the way and the women were very distressed, according to Kay Burley.

* **Update 2: 9:49am GMT:** 

Relatives unfurled a banner about an hour before today's press conference started in Mandarin.As the press tried to move in they were bundled out of the room.
A woman in her 50s or 60s who appeared heartbroken was manhandled and taken to another room. 

* **Update 3: 9:50am GMT:**

It is believed the relatives were trying to storm the conference but they were stopped by police.
Police were also stopping media from talking to the relatives.

* **Update 4: 10:04am GMT:** 

The press conference has now ended. But what's more interesting is what's been happening outside the media briefing.

Here's a summary of what happened:

Relatives of people on board the missing Malaysia Airlines plane today tried to stage a protest at the hotel where a daily press conference was taking place.
They tried to unfurl a banner for the media to see, but they were bundled into another room before being removed from the hotel.
One woman, believed to be in her 50s or 60s, was knocked to the floor amid all the confusion which was recorded by news cameras from around the world.
She screamed loudly as she was bundled away by police, up an escalator and into another room before being ushered out of the hotel by three men.
From inside the press conference, acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said: "Emotions are running high".

* **Update 5: 10:31am GMT:** (Not Confirmed)

The banner is believed to have said: "We demand the Malaysian government reveal the truth."

* **Update 6: 10:49am GMT:**

One of the main points to come out of the press conference was that files were deleted a month ago on a flight simulator at the pilot's home.
Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu said the records of simulations carried out on the machine were deleted on February 3.
However, acting transport minister Hishammudding Hussein said that pilot Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is innocent until proven guilty of any wrongdoing.

They were bundled into a room which is being guarded by Malaysian police.

[Video of sky news reporter Kay Burley caught up in press scrum at news conference.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=i5MXgLq-9uM)

* **Update 9: 11:28am GMT:**

Statement by Malaysia's minister of transport after two relatives of the missing passengers are forcibly removed after trying to protest.

“We regret the scenes at this afternoon’s press conference, involving some of the relatives of passengers on board MH370. One can only imagine the anguish they are going through. Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing. I have ordered an immediate inquiry into the events in the press room today.”

* **Update 10: 11:50am GMT:** 

Malaysian authorities have dismissed reports that islanders from the Maldives had seen a "low-flying jumbo jet" that could have been the missing MH370 plane.

Massive search continues, with “some priority” being given to southern search area in southern Indian Ocean.

Thailand radar may have picked up plane heading back towards Kuala Lumpur just eight minutes after it lost contact, but they say it soon disappeared from screens.

* **Update 11: 12:16pm GMT:** (Not Confirmed)

A couple of translations of what two women were saying as they were bundled out of the press room.

A middle aged woman shouted: "They are just saying wait for information. Wait for information. We don't know how long we have to wait.

"Why won't they give us an explanation? My son. It's been 12 days. I have been here 10 days ... every time we ask a question they don't give us answers."

She was then bundled away by police, up an escalator and into another room.

A second woman wearing sunglasses and a face mask said: "We call on the Malaysian government to give us information immediately. There is no information, just endless searching.

"We are not satisfied with the Malaysian government's conduct. We don't need the Malaysian government to take care of us. What we need is the truth. We need to know where the plane is," she said.

As she was carried away she repeatedly cried: "Where are they? Where are they?"

* **Update 12: 1:03pm GMT:**

At this morning's press conference acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein asked other countries to help by releasing their radar data.

He said: "I can confirm that we have received some radar data, but we are not at liberty to release information from other countries. I appeal to all our partners to continue volunteering any and all information that could help with the investigation and the search for MH370."


I'd feel really bad for the pilots families if the pilots end up not being at fault for this (like if it was a hijacking and they had no choice). The media is putting a lot of negative attention on them. 
Thank you so much for your work.  I am part of the silent majority who reads but doesn't have anything to say.
I've been reading a lot of news articles and commentary. All I can say at this point is that I am more confused than ever. I don't think I have seen a clear theory yet, too many contradictions in each one. Maybe it's just that we are missing key details or that the reports so far have not been accurate. I'm not sure, either way I hope one day we find the truth.

This case has also opened my eyes on how many bizarre incidents have occurred with airplanes. 
I've got a couple of questions to rule out some "far out" theories if you don't mind. (This is my first reddit post so please excuse me if I violate the reddiquette!): 

Can someone confirm that the avionics compartment on a 777-200ER is actually accessed from the cockpit and not from the cabin? Also, is there other ways to get to the avionics compartment say like from the outside (while on the ground), from the cargo, the cabin etc.?

How easy and fast can one enter the avionics compartment? Does it require tools? How about the opposite: entering the cockpit (or cabin?) from the avionics compartment?

Would it theoretically be possible to exit a 777 from the avionics compartment through an external access hatch, survive the exit and then parachute down?

From the PC: "Hishammuddin confirmed that Malaysia has received some new radar data, but would not reveal where it came from.

Thailand said its radar confirmed that the plane took a westerly turn. Hishammudin said the source of the data was sensitive and that it was up to the host country to release it. " 
The German Allianz Company, one of the biggest insurance houses in the world, has [announced](http://www.fz.com/content/allianz-starts-payment-missing-mh370-claims) they will pay out full life insurance sums for all passengers on mh370 that were under their cover.

This is, in my opinion, a very crucial piece of news as insurance companies usually have access to very high-quality information, and mostly hold back payments until it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that claimants are in fact never going to return.

PS-EDIT: The payout sum is reported to be over 130 million dollars, which is very far beyond what would be necessary in a classical marketing ploy. It is enough cash to make some shareholders shaky: [Stock](https://www.allianz.com/en/investor_relations/share/share-price.html) plunging down quite drastically this morning after announcement.
Omg it means absolutely nothing in itself that some data was deleted from a home flight sim. What is this...
 "Malaysian authorities have received background information from all countries with passengers on board the plane except Russia and Ukraine. So far, no information of significance has been found, he said." --CNN
