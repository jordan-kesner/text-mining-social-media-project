Title: CMV: Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is 100% wrong about religion and the Constitution

Post:
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia [argues](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/02/antonin-scalia-religion-government_n_5922944.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular) that the Constitution is only obligated to protect freedom of religion -- not freedom from it. "The separation of church and state doesn’t mean “the government cannot favor religion over non-religion,” Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia argued during a speech at Colorado Christian University on Wednesday, according to The Washington Times. "

He is absolutely wrong in his assertion. Freedom of religion is freedom from religion. There is not freedom to practice religious beliefs if you are required to adhere to any of the religious beliefs or rules of other religions. Favoring Christian prayer before government meetings forces all non-Christians to adhere to a religion they do not subscribe to. Allowing Ten Commandment monuments on public land forces Christian beliefs on all non-Christians.

You cannot have freedom of religion without freedom from religion and therefore, Scalia is 100% wrong.

> Freedom of religion is freedom from religion.

That's like saying that freedom of speech is freedom from speech; that only by forcing others to be silent are you truly free. Freedom OF religion is the capacity to practice or not as you wish, not to force others not to practice.

> There is not freedom to practice religious beliefs if you are required to adhere to any of the religious beliefs or rules of other religions.

And you're not being forced to do so; you're being "forced", if that's the right word, to live with others practicing their religions.

> Favoring Christian prayer before government meetings forces all non-Christians to adhere to a religion they do not subscribe to.

No, it doesn't. It just "forces" (again, I think, too strong of a word) to observe others adhering to their religion. If I listen to lady gaga next to you, I'm forcing you to hear it; I'm not forcing you to like it.

> Allowing Ten Commandment monuments on public land forces Christian beliefs on all non-Christians.

This would be a lot more compelling if other such things were being disallowed across the board. Sure, instances of such things can be found, but likewise instances of disallowing Christian iconography can be found. 

Trying to force atheism on others is no different or better than trying to force religion. Scalia's not trying to demand that you bow your head when others pray in a town meeting; rather, he's protecting the rights of others to do so if they wish.
I think the problem is you're equating "hearing a prayer" or "seeing religious imagery" to being forced to believe in it. 

How does seeing a 10 commandment monument automatically force you to believe in the 10 commandments?

How about the flying spaghetti monster? If someone next to you started praying to him..would you get equally upset and feel that their beliefs were being forced on you?

"Freedom of religion is freedom from religion" is catchy for a bumper sticker, but our Constitution is not a bumper sticker.  If there was freedom from religion the year wouldn't be 2014 and there wouldn't be seven days in a week.


There may (probably) be a legitimate beef with the prayer question, but I'll challenge you on religious imagery on public monuments because that's an area of interest of mine.  To me, it's nothing more than a lot of over-sensitivity because those are artistic expressions that really don't "force" anybody to do anything.  So the supreme court has a stone sculpture that shows Moses holding the ten commandments, so what?  It also shows the tortoise and the hare.  What am I being forced to do?  I can tell you nothing.  Yeah, it's tax payer dollars, but that's what the architect decided.  Maybe it's not to your taste, but there's no pleasing everybody.  Have you seen the Seattle public library?  That offends *me.*
If you can point to the phrase "Separation of Church and state" in the constitution, I'll send you a thousand dollars. It doesn't exist. 

The 1st amendment protects against an established religion, that is - a state sponsored and/or enforced religion. 

While you can make the argument that separation of church and state follows all of those things, you can't make the argument that the constitution, when it was written, had any inkling of keeping prayer out of a state building - only that they can't *make* you pray. 
The intent of the founders was clearly not about avoiding religion but merely preventing the creation of a national religion like there had been with the Church of England.

In fact, the act of restricting people in government from practicing their religion publicly is far closer to what they were trying to prevent than the practicing itself.
The way I see it is this....If someone wants to practice their faith or pray that's just fine. They can do it in public or in private. They have a right to their own personal freedom as long as they're not physically forcing me to believe what they believe. Seeing someone praying or expressing their faith in public doesn't offend me. Seeing isn't forcing me to believe or not believe. They aren't hurting me by living their life on their terms. So why should I take offence? If you want people to be tolerant of your right to believe in something or nothing at all, then you must return the favor.
There are always major issues with arguments about the meaning of the Amendments in the Bill of Rights:

1.  Do they mean whatever it is we want them to mean?  Do they mean what the people who wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights thought they meant?  Do they mean whatever the dictionary in 1791 would imply they mean?  

2.  Why does an Amendment which starts by saying, "Congress shall make no law..." have anything whatsoever to do with Nebraska making a law?  There is no argument that Nebraska counts as Congress.  The less common legal rational is something something 9th Amendment.  The more common one is that the 14th Amendment makes it apply.  

So, we end up with the following possible impasses:

- If the Amendments mean whatever we feel like they mean, then they can mean what you said, or they can mean what I want them to mean, they could mean nothing, we could take a vote, we could let 9 elite lawyers exercise arbitrary power in setting their meaning, etc.  We have entered the land of legalized sophistry where the rules are made up and the points don't matter (and changing one's view is a logical impossibility).  

- We could simply say the 9 elite lawyers are right because they say they're right, which is pretty much how the legal system actually works.  In that case your view of the meaning of the First Amendment as incorporated to the states by the 14th Amendment is correct to the extent that it is identical to the [Lemon Test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman#Lemon_test), and your view is wrong to any extent that it is divergent.  And your view on the application of the Lemon Test to any hypothetical situation is correct to the extent that 5 of the 9 elite lawyers would agree with you if that hypothetical actually came up.  

- If we suppose the First Amendment means what it meant in 1791, by either the minds of the people who wrote it or the dictionary standard it has one and only one possible meaning:  Several state governments had established religions in 1791 (like taxes were levied to fund the church, only members of the church could hold public office, etc.).  Congress could not make any law respecting (read: affecting) these establishments of religion, nor could Congress make any law prohibiting the free exercise of religion (which is a bit trickier to interpret but I'd just say look at all the then existing laws in Europe which prohibited the free exercise of religion and figure that's what they were talking about).  

- If we think that whatever the 14th Amendment makes the liberties protected by the First Amendment apply to states, then we have a whole different problem.  It's easy to say a state can't prohibit the free exercise of religion, or abridge the freedom of the press.  But how do we say that a state can't make a law respecting that state's established religion?  

When we apply that last conundrum to your point, we run into real trouble.  I mean if you really, truly think having the ten commandments on a public monument amounts to a "law prohibiting the free exercise of religion," well I won't bother trying to change your view, but I will say it's tremendously silly.  
This whole post was largely irrelevant to the *actual* question at hand, all because you chose the least charitable (and wrong) interpretation of what he was saying.  This is the correct phrasing:

>> Freedom of religion is freedom from [government endorsed] religion.

No one is saying anything remotely related to the concept of random people in a public space not being able to practice religion, as is obvious from the actual content of what he wrote, so your reply "objecting" to that idea that was never proposed didn't really further the conversation.

What is banned is anyone using their government *office* to endorse religion, which would include taking public money to fund such endorsements or subjecting a captive audience that they have authority over to listen to/watch them engage in religious practice.  This is all about what the *government* does and what its agents do *qua* government agents, not anything else.

Also, as an aside, you do not appear to know what the term "atheism" means.  It does not mean "secular", which is the actual word you were looking for, and when you use the correct word, your sentence no longer holds.
>Trying to force atheism on others is no different or better than trying to force religion. Scalia's not trying to demand that you bow your head when others pray in a town meeting; rather, he's protecting the rights of others to do so if they wish.


Theres is a difrence between someone or a group of people bowing their head for prayer and the person in charge leading a prayer. Its not trying to force anyone to be athiest, its saying that someone in a government position over us should not attemp to lead everyone in prayer during a government task.

Its like with your Lady Gaga example, I'm fine if you or a group of people decide they wish to listen. I'm less fine if I'm at court and the judge says that he wants all of the Gaga fans to put on her music, so they can get a moment of listining to her together. Its not why anyone is here, and having the non fans have to leave or plug their ears singles them out and could make the judge feel more of a bias toward helping his fellow Gaga fans.
> That's like saying that freedom of speech is freedom from speech; that only by forcing others to be silent are you truly free. Freedom OF religion is the capacity to practice or not as you wish, not to force others not to practice.

There is a nuance to this situation that you are missing. What we want is freedom from religion in government, and not to be free of witnessing other people be religious.

When a government entity like a school or city council has prayers, you cannot participate in government without also participating in a particular religion. If teachers lead satanic prayers, Christians would feel as if public schooling was not an option to them. Nobody cares about Christians praying, but when you turn government functions into partial church services, it excludes certain groups of people.

> No, it doesn't. It just "forces" (again, I think, too strong of a word) to observe others adhering to their religion. If I listen to lady gaga next to you, I'm forcing you to hear it; I'm not forcing you to like it.

This is not mere observation, you are having to be a part of the religious ceremony. If the law required you to attend a certain church, would you argue that you could just sit silently and be free in your religion, or would it feel like the presence of religion is being forced into your life?

This isn't about lady gaga, because I don't have to sit next to you to participate in my government.
