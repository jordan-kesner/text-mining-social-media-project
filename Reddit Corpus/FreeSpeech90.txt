Title: Conservatives Are Gearing Up to Falsely Blame Big Tech Censorship for Trump’s Loss: Social media actually favors conservatives and they ironically use it the most to their benefit but until they get total control to censor they will project their desire to censor on everyone else

If YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter were truly censoring conservatives-then there would be no such content on those platforms at all. Alex Jones and Rush Limbaugh never would have been able to open a YouTube channel, Trump would never have been able to open a Twitter feed.  That some right wing content gets taken down days more about how thoroughly they have abused the privilege.
These people get all their info from these sites so they assume every other person does as well.  

They think social media is what brainwashed liberals.  They can’t wrap their head around adults using facts and multiple sources to form well constructed/informed opinions.
Thus the hilarious jump to Parler because “free speech”. No it’s more like free from shit they don’t want to read. It’s funny.
Is social media favoring the conservative party a wide held belief on the left? Cause conservatives believe literally the exact opposite. I'm curious how  a system can be run to make both sides believe it is biased against them, and survive
I think conservatives appear outsized on social media (mostly YT and FB in this case, Twitter seems to ban them) because they are so under-represented in other areas (academics, journalism, etc.).

But on point, yes, Republicans blaming social media is dumb, the same way it was in 2016 when Dems were doing the blaming.

Seems like whenever somebody loses and election, it can never just be because their candidate or their ideas are bad, it has to be some sort of foul play.
