All of these paint a clear picture of a man who is an authoritarian who has disregard for the rule of law, who  dehumanizes his opponents who he portrays as simultaneously too strong and too weak, repeats white nationalist talking points, praises despots, and is willing to do anything for personal gain. He appeals by hearkening back to some ideal of lost greatness. I think this accurately describes a populist authoritarian demagogue, or more concisely a fascist.

>[**Fascism:**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism) a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition 

One of the big problems is that fascism itself is hard to precisely define as it has many varying and often contradictory features. I recommend reading this short 9-page essay on fascism by Umberto Eco (a professor who lived through Mussolini) who explores this and determines the essentials of fascism. Tell me if you see the similarities:
https://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf

It seems obvious to me that his personal philosophy and tactics can be accurately described as fascist. Many others agree:

Why do we feel the need to label him with the F word? He's obviously not anything close to Hitler or Mussolini in ideology or practice.... It's irresponsible to insinuate that he's of the same cloth
By the definition you provided, almost every system is "Fascist". USSR? Fascist! Cuba? Fascist! USA? Fascist! (& that going back through history before Fascism was even invented!) 

If Communism, Socialism, Monarchy & Theocracy all fit your definition of "Fascism", the definition loses all meaning.
I wouldn't call Trump a "fascist". Fascism is, as much as you may despise it, an ideology. And Trump has no ideology, as much as you may despise him. At least that's what I get from him. He is completely fluid and interchangeable on any topic. The only consistency I have seen is that everything that he perceives as "good" about him is praised and everything he perceives as "bad" about him is attacked with any means possible. 

He may demand loyalty and give loyalty, but only short term. As soon as an "enemy" says something good about him, they are golden. As soon as some associate strays, they become an enemy. Everything is transactional to him.

That doesn't mean anything you list above is wrong. Trump definitely said racist things and used fascist imagery and fascist tropes. And he would turn full fascist the second he thinks it would benefit him. But for now, he believes it doesn't. So he isn't a fascist.  Let's see what happens when he is impeached or loses the election.
I don't have time right now to go point by point, but all but about two of those bullets are presented from a very biased point of view.  I'm not saying your conclusion is absolutely wrong, but the way you've presented your "evidence" shows you aren't looking for objective truth to make a determination.

Easiest example is the "concentration camps" were from the Obama era and it's tough for something to be a concentration camp when you always have the option of walking the other way to avoid them.  

If this forum is truly about moderate presentation of politics then you should go back and provide a moderate point of view rather than one that is heavily biased.
Not too get too semantic, but I would say Trump can be fascistic, but not a fascist.  Like others have pointed out, he doesn't have a consistent ideology (other than of self-interest). You've given a lot of examples of his fascistic behaviors, but he has done plenty of things that could be listed that would argue against your claim.  He has supported [democratic world leaders](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-merkel/story?id=46198767), [praised hispanics](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/09/trump-latino-hispanic-vote-new-mexico-rally-speech-video-adviser.html), [insulted dictators and despots](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/world/asia/trump-kim-jong-un.html), and the list goes on. I don't deny that he's done the things you have on your list, but it's easy to find examples that don't fit into the narrative that your very selective list tries to support.
Trump has taken actions which smell fascist,  and I'm sure he would be happy if he was a fascist dictator.   However,  labeling him as *being a fascist* isn't accurate or helpful.     Fascism was a real ideology, with real adherents who didn't hide the fact that they were fascists.  

Their ideology was so unquestionably evil that the Soviet Union, the US, and a British empire on their last legs put aside their massive differences to purge it from the world: bombing cities into rubble, toppling entire nations,  and occupying them until it was certain that that ideology wouldn't continue on. Today,  it only continues as a boogeyman used to smear people who act sort of like fascists.  Doing that honestly belittles both the utter evil that was historical fascism and the many millions of people who died in order to destroy it.  It also limits our ability to understand history: any definition which labels Stalin a fascist conflicts that he *hated* fascism and that millions of communist citizens laid down their lives heroically to destroy that ideology. 

Facism was one type of right wing totalitarian ideology,  but it doesn't have a monopoly on that political area.   New variants of right wing totalitarianism are gaining power in the 21st century,  but they can be criticized in their own right without stooping to smearing them with boogie men:

**Trump is a wannabe dictator with hyper nationalist, anti-democratic,  and racialist political philosophies which would be extremely dangerous if he also had the ideological intensity and leadership abilities of a Stalin, Hitler, or Mussolini and came to power in the early 20th century.**

It's not the 20th century any more.  There aren't fascists, there aren't stalinists, and honestly the only real communists seem to be in North Korea.   Even Al Baghdadi wasn't a fascist, despite leading a murderous right wing totalitarian revolution.   Political discourse would be massively improved if we stuck to criticizing people for what they actually are.
George Orwell, in 1944, on the meaninglessness of “fascism”:

> The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies "something not desirable"...In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning.

In order to view the items in this list as 'facist', you have to be viewing the world through the lens of hatred for people who don't have the same belief's as yourself, with no interest in charity toward your fellow humans. The cliche way to label the person who hold this sort of document to be reliable would be as suffering from TDS.
I believe that's what he literally is, so I believe it's appropriate to call him such. I have made an exhaustive case to that effect. If you find the term offensive you should find the behavior it represents offensive as well.
