Setting aside for a moment the utter absurdity of doing volunteer work for mega corporations (consider a worthy cause) I don't see how maintaining personal fiefdoms constitutes keeping anybody safe.

Judging from social media they are doing a shit job.
lmao at pretending 99% aren't just doing it for the power trip/e-peen. 

All they keep communities safe from are opinions they personally don't like, and they do it >for free.
A lot of them are just doing it to tilt the conversation to their bias by pruning the most influential posters who disagree with their world view.

Sauce: I am in the top 0.001% of Reddit users for community appreciation and banned in my top 4 subs.
Is this post suggesting that Reddit mods do it for any reason other than the power trip and control? Do the Reddit mods even believe that?
Working for free for a tech corporation worth billions is pretty embarassing. I wholly believe itâ€™s more a narcissistic power trip thing than an actual interest or hobby. 
Yall should just fuckin unionize
