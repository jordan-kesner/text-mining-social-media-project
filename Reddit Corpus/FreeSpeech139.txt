Summary of the debate so far:

"AHHHHHH TERRORISTS!"

"OMG TERRORISTS!"

"IMA KILL ME SOME TERRORISTS LIKE REAGAN!"

"FUCK YO QUESTION WIGGA ISIS IS AFTER US!"

"I FUCKING LOVE BOMBS!"
Good call on not giving the link here. A lot easier for them to discredit the votes if they see a whole bunch of votes coming just from reddit.
Unfortunately I don't think this has gone all that well for Rand. Started off fine, but he's sort of disappeared. I suspect that was intentional on the part of the moderators, but still, this isn't going to give him the significant lift he needs. I voted for him in the poll on two accounts though so I hope I'm wrong.
My colleague here wants to slice them, that's totally stupid and irresponsible. We need to dice them! (pause for applause) Dice them (interrupted by applause), and dice them until their dogs are cubed!! (applause becomes overwhelming) Slice them, how stupid!
