Title: CMV: China is bad and I dislike the country for its government

Post:
I am a gamer, I truly don't care a whole lot about politics. I do keep up with some breatuberish people because I like watching their content, but my general position is that the U.S. government sucks and it isn't my job to fix it because I want to do other things.


Recently, there have been some incidents where gaming/entertainment people have been fired/disciplined for going against the political interest of china. Here are some examples:

It is fresh in my mind because there was just another TI in china with some drama. That said, this relates more to the government than the more recent incident with Kuku)

Yeah so I dislike china and its government. No qualms with the people. I feel that they are limit free speech in their own country and combine their political stances with their economy(through propaganda or whatever) to force their view on the rest of the world. At the very least, I prefer governments that can be HEAVILY criticized constantly. Take America! All the europeans I've ever met have strong opinions on all the things we are doing wrong and I would be happy to have them come to America and give a speech about it. It is fine. America does a lot wrong but we are fairly good at politics(ignoring the horrible high profile cases)

I honestly think that one human trying to make money and work in a field he/she likes should not have to "watch their mouth" about china, they suck and are bad. Money be damned.

Gaming companies have been known to censor something in worldwide releases of their game so China can play it and also have been known to moderate Twitch chat and the like so that Tiannanmen Square is auto-moderated. Absolutely RIDICULOUS


All this leads to me thinking China is bad. CMV!

I don't think anyone is gonna disagree with you that China's authoritarian government is bad, unless they also believe individual freedom is bad (which, philosophically, has its points).

However I do think your line of reasoning is a little weird, because you say you also think the US government sucks and you prefer governments that can be criticized. This strikes me as a really weird definition of a good government.

I live in China for many years so I'll bite.

First of, what a lot of people don't take into account when they think about China is that it's just not another country, **it's another civilisation**. This means that there is very little cultural basis of understanding between us westerners and the Chinese, we have essentially no common roots. For instance you might think that Arabic countries are extremely different from us: they're infinitely less different than China since they have an Abrahamic religion (Islam) that forms the root of their culture, same as ours. Everything that defines our values and culture (what we inherited from old prophets, ancient Greece, the Roman empire, the enlightenment, etc.) doesn't register in China. China has a culture that evolved essentially closed-off from the rest of the world for 5'000 years! Their roots are people like Confucius, Laozi, Qin Shi Huang, Huangdi, etc. People whose names mean close to nothing to us Westerners, like our historical figures (Abraham, Plato, Socrates, Moses, etc.) mean close to nothing to the Chinese.

All of this means that it's easy to find their thinking and actions laughable: it's extremely foreign to us, it's incomprehensible, we have no idea where they're coming from. To truly understand what it's about you'd need to be raised in China. But since you weren't, the only thing you can do is try to take a very big step back and have a very open mind. You simply cannot judge China from a Western standpoint.

For instance, freedom of speech. There is a long tradition of debating ideas and contradictory debate in the West, for thousands of years. Heck the bible - including the old testament - is all about guys changing the world with revolutionary new ideas and those guys are our models. That is simply not the case in China. Chinese culture abhors chaos above all else, everything is about tending towards harmony. This isn't the CCP's doing, it's been the case long before: ideas aren't introduced through public debates but rather via schools of thought that gain more or less power in the government apparatus. Equally the Chinese value deeds much more than talk, talk is cheap in China: for instance never in a Chinese family do people say "I love you" to each others, that's considered hypocritical. Instead they act in ways that demonstrate their feelings: work hard for each others, give each others money, etc. Last thing: power of the central government. Throughout Chinese history, whenever people started openly criticizing the central government it could only mean one thing: that the government was weak and that some sort of coup was brewing. In the West criticizing the government is as natural as breathing air, the government is actually stronger for it as it pushes it to reform itself and it's generally healthy to let people vent. It's the contrary in China: it's a loss of face, a sign of weakness and troubles to come. I'm not speaking here about what the government thinks: this is how the common man views the world here. 

Second thing: imposing their views on the rest of the world. If there is one thing the Chinese do not do, that is it. China has, on the contrary, a natural tendency to close itself off from us "barbarians" (the official way we were called until the late 19th century). If they listened to their instincts, they would just leave us alone and happily live among each others. Two anecdotes to illustrate this. 1) read [this letter by the emperor Qianlong to King George III](https://china.usc.edu/emperor-qianlong-letter-george-iii-1793), it is a perfect illustration of the Chinese view of the outside world, at least historically. King George III had sent envoys to China, bearing many gifts, to ask the emperor to extend trade with Britain and ask for the establishment of a British embassy in Beijing. The emperor replied that China "possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its borders. There is therefore no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians." He also refused the establishment of an embassy because, essentially, barbarians were too different from the Chinese and he could therefore not allow them to live in their midst. 2) Second anecdote. In the Fujian province of China there is a group of people called the "Hakka" or "Kejia" in Chinese. Kejia literally means "guest families": they're Han Chinese from northern China who migrated south more than 1'000 years ago. Yet 1'000 years after and despite being Han Chinese (the same ethnie as the locals) they're still considered "guests" in the south, they're still a distinct group with distinct villages, customs, etc. This is extraordinarily illustrative of the Chinese mentality: strangers will remain so forever, generation after generation, there is absolutely no integration nor assimilation possible. And if they can't integrate, change or otherwise assimilate people from the same ethnie and cultural background as themselves, do you think they believe there is any hope to impose their ideas onto complete strangers like us? Not in a million years. The Chinese culture doesn't allow for assimilation: a foreigner can never become Chinese (in fact I think that's basically never happened in mainland China) and once a Chinese acquires foreign nationality they lose their Chinese nationality forever. They simply do not want to even try to convert foreigners to being Chinese, it's a totally closed-off society.

I'm not trying to make you agree with what the Chinese are doing, just trying to make you understand, however slightly, where they're coming from. When you look at the recent events with that in mind, things might make a tiny bit more sense. For instance when they're "banning" the Houston Rockets it's not that they're trying to impose their views onto us: they couldn't care less about that. It's because NBA is very popular in China (especially the Rockets since it was Yao Ming's team) and it's simply unthinkable to allow such a public slap in the central government's face from such a popular institution. Everyone in China would take it as a signal that it's now open field for criticism.

Lastly, it's easy with Western eyes to be extremely critical (to speak mildly) of the Chinese government. But the fact is that for the past 30 years the government is extremely popular here. It's not propaganda: people are genuinely happy with the direction the country is taking. Why wouldn't they be? During the past 30 years, China has seen the largest explosion of wealth in the history of mankind. Hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty and the Chinese middle-class is now larger than the US's and Europe's combined. Again in China talk is cheap, deeds are everything. If you tell a random Chinese "But you can't criticize the government" they'll reply to you "Why would I?", they culturally have no notion of the importance of upholding enlightenment principles. As a very last point it's easy in the West to think that because of the absence of freedom of speech the Chinese are muzzled and have no means to express dissatisfaction with the authorities. If you live here for a little while you'd realize how wrong this view is: despite the absence of freedom of speech the Chinese are educated to see the government has a benevolent father figure and they'll not hesitate a second to express their dissatisfaction to authority figures. They are absolutely not afraid of the government like you're probably not afraid of your father: you strongly believe he has your better interest in mind. Go to any police station in China to see this for yourself: you'll undoubtedly find a random grandma shout her heart out to the officers in charge, just like a daughter would shout to her father if she was distressed. They're the most straightforward people anywhere in the world (sometimes very rudely so) and are absolutely not afraid to express their feelings. Just not in an open forum that would make the government lose face.

That was a long one and I'm not sure I changed your view but I hope I at least managed to make you better understand this very misunderstood country.
I agree with your dislike of the Chinese government, and share your anger over people being disciplined/fired for criticizing them.  However, I would point out that this kind of thing happens in America all the time. 

There are countless examples of people being fired for criticizing their employer in their private life, or publicly advocating for positons counter to their employers interests. Most of the time, it gets little or no attention.  

The difference in this case is because of China's centralized power, they functionally act as if they themselves are the company.  And because of their recent embrace of Capitalism, they can now exert their financial power on non-Chinese businesses.  

It seems different because its a country, but this dynamic has existed for ages. It is, in fact, a feature of Capitalism, which intrinsicly protects the power of capital over individuals. 

So, does that bother you too?
I'm American born Chinese. My father's family fled Communist China to Hong Kong (they lost everything), and he was born in in Hong Kong. He came to the US for high school in the 60s, and my mother was born here in the US. Here's how my father explained / helped me understand the viewpoint of the Chinese government when I was a kid:

In America and in the developed, Western world, people view a specific set of human rights as inalienable - among them, the right to free speech, the right to due process, etc. But in these locations, people are generally well-off and society is stable.

China’s history over the last two centuries has been filled with conflict, strife, and instability. It was basically two centuries of European powers subjugating Chinese governments and forcing them to sign humiliating treaties and drug Chinese citizens with opium, infighting among warlords, Japanese soldiers raping & killing people – pretty extreme shit that a lot of people blamed on incompetent government and leaders.

So in comes the Chinese government today, which has ushered in an era of tremendous growth, prosperity, and probably most importantly, stability for China’s citizens. In exchange for this, they demand that Chinese people give up some of the freedoms that we in the western world take for granted – namely the right to criticize the government. Chinese citizens are mostly ok with this.

Let’s quantify the effect of the prosperity ushered under this government – according to Google, China’s GDP per capita grew from $200 to $8,800 from 1980 to 2018 – that’s an increase of 44x! GDP per capita in the US in 1980 was $12,600. In 2018, it was $60,000. A 44x increase over 1980 levels would have meant that the average family in 2018 would be making $550k a year!**\*\*** I think if you went around in the US asking families if they would be willing to give up their right to criticize the government in exchange for a salary of $550k per year, many of them would say yes.

I also see a lot of discussion around authoritarian vs. democratic governments, and I wanted to address that as well: The most famous ancient Greek philosophers (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle) actually were super elitist and hated democracy. Socrates’ argument was that democracy is inherently corrupt, since it gives in to the will of people (who are idiots) and mob rule (i.e., we will wind up electing morons, charlatans, and hedonists – remind you of anyone?). Plato, who was Socrates’ student, wrote in *The Republic* that the ideal form of government wasn’t a Republic, but a benevolent dictatorship, where an authoritarian government has control but enacts laws in the best interest of its people.

So the Chinese government believes it is the benevolent authoritarian ruler of China. And in general, most of its citizens are pretty happy today. And relative to any of China’s other governments in recent history, it’s actually been the best by far for its citizens. So you with your Western morals gets a little frustrated, and western businesses get annoyed that they can't sell their wares to Chinese people (but remember the Chinese government is extremely wary protecting their citizens from potential damaging impact of foreign-made goods sold to Chinese people after the opium wars)... The Chinese government makes the Chinese people (who you yourself say you like / don't have a problem with) happy, they just don't make you happy.

**TL, DR:** Chinese history over the last 200 years was very unstable and lots of people died and/or were miserable. Chinese people blame this on weak leadership. The Chinese government today projects strength, and to their citizens, economic growth and prosperity and societal stability for limited freedom to criticize the government is a worthwhile trade.

China as a political entity has been around for over 2000 years. Communist China has only been around since the 40s. Today’s capitalist/communist China has only been around since the 90s or early 2000s.

When something’s been around for 2000 years, it has been the good guy and the bad guy and everything in between on every topic.

There are over a billion people in China. They are not all of one mind. Hating a nation makes little sense because someone does not control what nation they are born into. Good people are born into every nation.

Hating China’s _government_ makes sense. They do evil, corrupt things. That’s fine.

But if you’re so pissed about this you have not been paying attention to news about the US (assuming you are a US citizen). We have put kids in cages in the last year. Yesterday we abandoned the Kurds who fought for us to Turkey who will likely annihilate them. For a country that struts about civil rights on the global stage, there’s tremendous violations in the US that are incredibly embarrassing.
I'm a Chinese living in the US. I agree with you on your criticism towards the lack of freedom in China. But I'm gonna offer another perspective.

Sports/games can be a great bonding media between nations and cultures. Thus in my opinion sport events should try not to involve politics, as it only polarize people. That's why Olympic Games try to stay away from those stuff as much as possible. And I believe all international game events should avoid unnecessary political involvement.

Now NBA is not international, so it doesn't fall into that category in general. But it does make money in China. If you make money from someone while criticizing them openly, well, that's your freedom but it's just not nice. And that's all the Chinese people are saying to NBA: you are not very nice to us and I don't wanna see you anymore.

I see NBA's presence in China as a very positive influence. It opens a window for the average Chinese to see America and learn about the country. I would be a regrettable if it leaves.

**Edit:**

I was a little off the topic. So to the original topic:

1. I agree that censorship is generally a bad thing. That is to say, to ban some non-political game elements is bad.
2. However, international sport events/games should try to stay away from politics as much as possible.
3. NBA is a national event but it makes money internationally (particularly, in China).
We do not know how to successfully run a country with 1.3 billion inhabitants. It has never been tried in the history of the world. By successful, I mean something that is not always on the verge of devolving into chaos, civil war etc. A place where people can be happy, well fed and productive, optimistic about the future etc. Also a bit historical context about China: historically when China devolved into chaos, it always was a *very* bloody affair.

I hate China for its authoritarian bend. But sometimes I wonder, is there really another way? 1.3 billion people with unlimited individual freedoms, can it possibly peacefully work?
>  I truly don't care a whole lot about politics 

This is sort of what is keeping you from grasping why China is doing what it is doing, which is essential to understand before you make a claim that the country is simply "bad".

In reading these sources you provided, it is without a doubt true that China censors and actively takes stances within their economy to subordinate things to the Communist Party; and by extension the Chinese state apparatus. In continuing with this argument, I just want to stress a few things. First, China is a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist(ish) state that operates, first and foremost, as a dictatorship of the proletariat as a class. This, of course, is tempered by the reality that China may very well be slipping into the same reaction and conservative nature that the USSR suffered from. Second, I really want to challenge the idea that China is "bad" simply because of their censorship because when understood in the context of their political situation, it becomes fairly understandable.

> I feel that they are limit free speech in their own country and combine their political stances with their economy 

This is a true statement. Marxists inexplicably feel the need to bundle politics and economics. So much so, that Marx's great "Das Capital" is not a political book or economic book but a book on political economy. A communist sees politics and economics as intrinsically linked, with the one being supported by the other and vice versa. This is how capitalism sustains liberal democracy and vice versa. As communists, the Chinese Communist Party seeks to abolish capitalism which means utilizing their unique economic position to pressure capitalism and capitalists; who are, nominally, those who believe in liberal democracy. 

Let's not forget that capitalist liberal democracies tend to push Marxist or socialist ideas to the wayside and even censor them to a degree by utilizing its own propaganda. History that was well-known is not taught or glossed over to preserve the veneer of capitalist liberal democracies. Capitalism's insidious and invisible nature makes it nearly impossible to fight against. 

And that is where the state comes in.

Lenin first wrote that the use of the state for the purpose of revolution, that being the continuous process of fighting capitalism, was a necessity; one abandoned by anarchist thinkers. The state is a mechanism by which the working class, that is those who do NOT make money through ownership, can flip the script on the capitalist ruling class that existed in a certain geographic territory. This is Lenin's "dictatorship of the proletariat" as opposed to the "dictatorship of the bourgeoisie" which most working class people experience in a capitalist liberal democracy. This is why the state is wielded by the Chinese Communist Party as a weapon, to be used against enemies both foreign and domestic. Again, this utilization of state power is one that capitalist liberal democracies have used time and time again to crush socialists and labor movements; therefore, communists view the use of the state against class enemies as fair game. 

> At the very least, I prefer governments that can be HEAVILY criticized constantly 

The "constantly" part is where China would disagree. China practices what is known as "democratic centralism" wherein the members of the Chinese Communist Party can debate the merits of a policy but once a line of action is agreed upon, debate is to cease; this is the same system utilized by most Marxist-Leninist states. China also incorporates a system called the "mass line" wherein the CCP will ask the farmers of the country how they feel the country should be moving and what is going right and wrong and then incorporating the answers into policy.

The difference here is that when a policy is adopted, it is no longer criticized and is followed. This is an old Bolshevik tactic that was incredibly useful during the Russian Civil War and the Chinese Civil War. Of course, policies can be revisited, but blatant attacks on the Party for an incorrect policy in public was never tolerated. Image issues aside, dissension in the Party is regrettable at best and a death knell for any revolution at worst.

> America does a lot wrong but we are fairly good at politics 

We are horrible at politics and far, far worse than China. Politics does not exist in the United States. Both parties are effectively the same ideology, just arguing about efficiency for the most part. Ideological questions are normally denied room to be discussed. To quote the old adage: "When I feed the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why are there poor, they call me a communist".

America is ridiculously conservative and is an absolute Leviathan that would make Hobbes shit himself. 

> I honestly think that one human trying to make money and work in a field he/she likes should not have to "watch their mouth" about china, they suck and are bad. 

China is doing what they are doing to abolish wage-slavery. Don't forget, that many basic necessities which are privatized here in the United States are free in China and job placement is not a horrid fear like it is here. China, as the lone socialist superpower, in their view has to hold onto power to abolish capitalism, end wage-slavery, and end class society as a whole. To do that, they have to utilize state power to enforce censorship in line with democratic centralism so that the strength of the Party is retained. If anything, this shows how dominant China has become in actually waging its economic fight over capitalism; it can subordinate foreign companies to the state and thereby the Party and thereby the proletariat as a class.

So to say that China is "bad" without understanding that their whole worldview involves them as the lone socialist superpower and that they must utilize state power to keep the proletariat as the dominant class over the bourgeois capitalists lest capitalist class society reassert itself, is to fail to understand China within their specific contextual moment. China, in a Marxian analysis, is only asserting its proletarian state power against the capitalist states in the few ways that it can; that is, it is silencing dissent that would seek to reinstitute capitalist class society and forcing corporations that want to come to China and do things there to be subordinated to the proletarian state.
