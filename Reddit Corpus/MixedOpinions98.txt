Title: State of the Sub: Grass-Touching Edition

Post:
Another year of politics comes to a close, and you know what that means…

### Holiday Hiatus

As we have done in the past, the Mod Team has opted to put the subreddit on pause for the holidays so everyone (Mods and users) can enjoy some time off and away from the grind of political discourse. We will do this by making the sub 'semi-private' from December 18th 2023 to January 1st 2024. 

Spend time with friends and family. Pick up a new hobby. Touch grass/snow/dirt... Whatever you do, we encourage you to step away from politics and enjoy the other wonderful aspects of your life. Or don't, and join the political shitposting in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/EJ4qAQu) until the subreddit comes back in the new year.

### ModeratePolitics Subreddit Demographics Survey

Can you believe it's been over 18 months since our last [Subreddit Demographics Survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/vgl5sw/results_2022_rmoderatepolitics_subreddit/)? We feel that we're overdue for another one, especially as we head into another eventful election year. As we have done in the past though, we'd like your feedback on what types of statistics you'd like us to gather about the community, and what policies/political opinions we should dig into. We welcome your feedback, both in this thread and via Modmail.

### New Mod!

We added Targren to the Mod Team earlier this year! They haven't fucked up too badly so far, so we're generally happy with the addition.

If anyone else is interested in joining the Mod team, feel free to hit us up in modmail or Discord. We'll likely do a more official "call for mods" next year.

### Transparency Report

Anti-Evil Operations have acted on average 13 times per month since our last State of the Sub.

I’d love to see questions about people’s opinions about appropriate/justified political expression. I feel like we constantly see people condemning very similar actions by people when it’s for reasons that they disagree with (example: BLM blocking roads vs Canadian truckers blocking roads) so I’d be interested to see some questions parsing out what people think is and isn’t appropriate. I’d love to see it done as a spectrum from voting and civil disobedience to civil unrest and all the way to rioting, with questions being along the lines of “never justified” to “sometimes justified” to “always justified.”

Alternatively, maybe some questions about what people consider patriotic? Could be just a list of things where you select all that you consider patriotic behavior or maybe rank them based on what you consider most patriotic. I think people’s visions of what is and isn’t patriotic has splintered with increased political polarization, so it’d be interesting to see what everyone thinks about stuff like voting, service in the armed forces/civilian service, protesting, flag burning, open carry, etc.
The last survey had a bunch of question on culture war issues like abortion and guns. I think a series of more specific questions on economics could be interesting.

Topics might include:

* How significant of a problem is our current level of debt
* How significant of a problem is our current deficit
* What are the ideal methods of taxation, e.g. land value tax vs' VAT vs' income vs' wealth vs' capital gains
* Should we implement a UBI, a Friedman-like negative income tax, something else, neither?
* Should the Fed have a single mandate for inflation or a dual mandate balancing inflation and unemployment
* Free trade? Fair trade? Autarky?
* A question regarding the YIMBY/NIMBY schism and housing creation
This might be a bit silly but I think it'd be fun to have a "bets/predictions" section that can be compared with US election results in 2024. Who people think will be the President, electoral college numbers, stuff like that.
I still can't get over the fact that Reddit unironically created something called "Anti-Evil Operations."

Anyway, I think it'd be interesting to have a section on immigration laws, similar to the abortion and gun law sections in the previous survey. While this has always been a major issue, it especially has been lately.

You might also consider a section on Jan 6 and/or Project 2025. Basically, how threatening to democracy do people think Trump is?
Would it be possible to include the ideational populism scale in the survey? It is a scale that measures how populist someone's political views are and includes the following questions:

* Politicians should always listen closely to the problems of the people.

* Politicians don't have to spend time among ordinary people to do a good job.

* The will of the people should be the highest principle in this country's politics.

* The government is pretty much run by a few big interests looking out for themselves.

* Government officials use their power to try to improve peoples lives.

* Quite a few of the people running the government are crooked.

* You can tell is a person is good or bad if you know their politics.

* The people I disagree with politically are not evil.

* The people I disagree with politically are just misinformed.

They are all on a seven-point semantic differential scale (So the respondent rates how much they agree or disagree on a scale ranging from 1: Strongly disagree to 7: Strongly Agree). If you decide to include it, I can help you calculate the populism scores for the results.

God no.  After moderating a political message board for 15 years before the members broke each other, never again.  Full respect for y'all doing so.  It's a near impossible task where someone's always unhappy with you.

I offered at the last go-around. Didn't hear anything, which I took to mean "No, thanks."
What address do I send the case of holiday booze to all mods? You'll need it in the new year!
