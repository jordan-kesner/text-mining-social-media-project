Title: Pew Research: Roughly half of U.S. adults (48%) now say the government should take steps to restrict false information online, even if it means losing some freedom to access and publish content. That is up from 39% in 2018

I agree that something needs to be done, but fuuuuck. Not by the government. 

Why in the hell would i ever want those guys to control what is true on the internet.
No. This is stupid AF. When speech is restricted, people jump to conspiracy theories and cling to stupid shit even more. Not to mention the whole free speech thing we have going on in the US 

Keep counter acting , "false information" with good information . It's been proven to be more effective.
No no no no no. You do NOT want the government determining what is and is not false information and censoring autonomously. I'm fine with having to vet my news just like everyone else is supposed to.

Why do half of Americans trust the government all of the sudden?
I read that Supreme Court is going to reassess the previous decision that media can print misinformation as protected speech.
