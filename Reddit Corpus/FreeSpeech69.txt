Title: Under current antitrust legislation, can anything be done about big tech’s monopoly on and heavy censorship of public discourse?    

Post:
Impartiality should be mandatory in any level of moderation in the public square, laws have not caught up with technology. 

As it stands, Meta & Reddit have almost  complete control over the dissemination of information. Reddit is the only anonymous message board left with any sort of traffic. What would have to happen to either change this or end the draconian moderation?

Sure, laws have been introduced in the past to prevent any one media company from gaining a monopoly in the market.

The problem is one of political will, not the ability to legislate.
No, i think it’s clear specific legislation needs to be made to reel them in. But how it can be done is beyond me, clearly the dinosaurs representing us are not tech experts.  At the very least there should be zero involvement between the federal government and social media companies as far as censorship goes.  But even without that involvement, it’s clear we still have a big problem on our hands
