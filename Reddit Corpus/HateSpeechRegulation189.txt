Title: Think Facebook has an anti-vaxxer problem? You should see Amazon - The problem of distrust runs deeper than social media, with Amazon's recommendation algorithms also pushing people towards anti-vaxx content

Can I also get some acknowledgement that Netflix and Amazon both have a *serious* problem with pseudoscientific and or conspiracy theory-laden documentaries?
Was looking for a movie on Amazon Prime the other day and came across one called *Vaxxed* which is about "the CDC cover-up of the link between the MMR vaccine and autism" and I shouted at my TV so loudly when I read the description that I scared my dog out of her nap.
Also, the fb robot acts exactly opposite of what users want

I see one of those silly anti-vax posts, and argue against it

The fb robot notices that I'm interacting with the content

It sends me more

FB needs the ability to downvote crappy stuff
YouTube keeps recommending alt right crap to me no matter how much I say I’m not interested, so I’m not surprised about this bs.
I'm actually banned from leaving reviews on amazon because I left a review on a "Flat Earth" book discussing how its nonsense. To make matters worse, I have complained to Amazon and they will not correct my banning.

The people who run amazon are complicit in the pushing of utter nonsense and silencing those who try to refute it.
Can we talk about google, also?  If I ever search for something remotely medical (like for instance I was looking for anti-parasite pills) you will have to sift through page after page of new age bullshit websites trying to sell you on their “natural remedies” before you can find a serious site.
