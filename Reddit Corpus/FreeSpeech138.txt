Title: Why are so many here claiming to be libertarians when they're only "libertarian" on weed and cops?

Post:
Yeah, those are important, but it's HILARIOUS seeing so many """libertarians""" backpedaling on hating the state whenever taxes, vaccine choice, school choice, student debt forgiveness and censorship are brought up. They want a less invasive government (unless the government is invasive on thing I like.)

It would be much easier to have a debate with these people if they branded themselves as what they really are: demsocs. Just be honest over who you are.

I'm also libertarian on guns and gay rights and keeping government small and responsive to the people, and low taxes to keep the government from the mischief that comes with having more money than it actually needs to perform the functions it's actually instituted for.
I come here because of all the political subs on Reddit this is by far the most diverse and conducive to having an actual discussion with folks that often don’t share my own viewpoints.

There are hardcore libertarians on her, bleeding heart liberals, staunch conservatives, and everything in between.

It’s a shit show and I’m here for it frankly.
This begs the question: On how many issues must you be Libertarian to be considered a true Libertarian?  All?  A majority?  Say, more than 1 or 2?
Maybe because identify as a libertarian since the majority of my beliefs are, that doesn’t mean they all are. Diversity of thought is conducive to better choices.
OP has a moderate libertarian flair.  WTF does OP think moderate means? That you’re purely libertarian on every issue? That there should be zero government? I think that sub is r/anarchy.  

As others have said, it’s a matter of degrees along a spectrum.   Yes, libertarian are allowed to choose where Each thinks government has a role.
This is posed literally every week, shut up already it's not gonna change. Mods aren't gonna ban anyone because they weren't libertarian enough.
