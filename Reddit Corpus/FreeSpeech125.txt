Title: Should fascist ideas be censored?

Post:
I recently got involved in this online debate about freedom of speech.

It is my opinion that freedom of speech applies even to nazis. The other person argued that nazis should be censored.

The debate went like this.

**Other person**:

When the nazis where not censored in 1930’s Germany, it lead to the holocaust and situation. That is what happens when nazis enjoy freedom of speech.

**Me**:

Using that logic, I could say that an anti-abortion advocate should not be allowed to express their views openly, because historically abortion bans have lead to 13 year old rape victims being forced to remain pregnant.

**Other person**:

Only fascist ideas should be censored.

Fascism is pretty well defined. Fascism, by definition, is a far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement, characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation and race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy. Fascism rose to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries, most notably Germany. Fascism also had adherents outside of Europe.

Only if the idea for which you advocate fits the above definition should the idea be censored. Abortion bans are a bad idea, but they do not fit the definition of fascism and therefore should not be on the chopping block for censorship.

Before having that debate, I was 100% positive that censoring nazis is a bad idea. Now I’m wavering at 80-90% certainty. What do you think? Should nazis be censored? Should we encode a law stating that advocating for fascism is not protected by freedom of speech? Let me know.

The ironic thing is that, back in the 1920s and 30s, socialism was on the rise and starting to get violent (particularly in the USSR), against the then-dominant classical liberal order. It was the fascists that advocated for restrictions on free speech to silence the socialists and they came to power in part because the liberals were not silencing the socialists.

Far left authoritarianism is not better than far right authoritarianism. 

Perhaps you should ask whether advocating for socialism ought to be banned. After all, that led to Mao's Great Leap Backward, the Soviet gulags and Holodomor, and the Cambodian genocide. Cuba and North Korea each continue to claim to be a socialist paradise.

The KKK wasn't banned in the US. The Weather Underground wasn't banned in the US. The American Nazi Party wasn't banned. The Communist party isn't banned. Certain actions they might take are prohibited, but their speech is not, and the country has survived.

You need to have more conviction. Literally everything that's been argued in the public sphere in the USA in the last couple years has been called fascist.

Whoever gets to decide "this is the line you cannot cross with speech" is a fascist. Therefore, banning any speech is fascist.
When you censor speech you don't really keep things from being said, you just keep bad ideas out of the cleansing light of public scrutiny. What's going to be said **will** be said, censorship just means it will be whispered ear to ear.

And yeah, lack of censorship very well may lead to bad things, but that kind of danger is the cost of freedom. At least we have a historical precedent to ~~ignore and repeat regardless~~ learn from.
No idea should be censored.  The more open discussion about ideas the easier it is to understand.  Harmful ideologies will be easier exposed if discussed freely.
I'm old enough to remember ACLU defending neo-nazis right to free speech. Back then the ACLU actually supported civil liberties.
people are allowed to say and believe what ever they want. even if its a stupid idea. 

but they are not allowed to censor other people or restrict the rights of others.  while i understand that fascism is bad and the ideology could spread. until they start forcing their ideas on others, they are not in violation of the Principles of Liberty (or Non-Agression Principle).

The issue with censoring any one ideology is complex because who gets to say who or what should be censored? its a slippery slop into a dictatorship even if its to stop Fascism.  remember one of the Nazi's biggest opponents was Communism.
The only speech that is protected by the 1st amendment is offensive speech, because nobody ever tries to ban non offensive speech. I think this is one of the greatest things about the US: The right to be a complete idiot and not be arrested.
