Title: President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened social media companies with new regulation or shuttering - It's clear now more than ever he's an authoritarian, corporate socialist.

Given how much he has violated Twitter’s TOS, they should just whip out some big dick energy and shut down his account to put Trump back in his lane.
Clearly this is the most important thing happening in this country right now in his mind.

I kind of wish there was video of when he found out they tagged his tweet. I bet he started crying.
I don’t agree with what trump said or why. Twitter though is not simply a content platform. They’re a provider with editorial powers and have used it quite frequently. 

As such they are not protected by laws which prevent them from getting sued for content they allow and provide. They are responsible.
Authoritarian? yes. Socialist? No. The guy literally bashes socialism every chance he gets when out campaigning. But he did want to turn the presidency into a lifetime gig.
Democrats threaten private enterprises for failing to censor conservative viewpoints. Republicans threaten private enterprises for censoring conservative viewpoints.

The two party system is authoritarian, and anti-liberty.
The dominant "social media companies" (including Reddit) are government propaganda departments, not free market entities.  Who do you think's been pumping in billions in investment when, for many years, they couldn't make a penny in profit?

# ***r/Libertarian is a communist lie!***
