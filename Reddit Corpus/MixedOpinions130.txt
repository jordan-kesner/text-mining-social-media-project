Title: CMV: The censorship going around has set a bad precedent and is leading to a slippery slope

Post:
I’m personally a near free speech absolutist and I believe once a social media network or app gets large enough, it should be regulated and treated as a ~~public square (where the only type of speech that can be censored but more so held legally liable are slander, threats of violence and whatever is prosecutable by the law).~~

I do not believe social media should be treated as a public square, I will award those whose comments I read, deltas.

I’ve noticed more and more (especially on Reddit) deleted comments everywhere, communities shut down that are increasingly more tame (2balkan4you).

The more you censor these communities and ideas, the more you get them congregating in areas that are dense echo chambers and the less likely you can change these peoples minds with opposing beliefs.

I believe there are very few things that should allow for banning (these things are as I mentioned but also a few extra topics namely GROSS & harmful misinformation; including saying covid vaccines scramble DNA but NOT including the earth was flat)

Edit: please give me some time to read your replies and get back to you all. I am currently a little busy and will have to digest responses before responding

# Edit 2: Please read below!

This is entirely my fault (especially with the public square comment) and I should have been more specific. I am **not** advocating for a **complete ban on moderation**, I am simply looking for an argument why the current level of moderation happening is fine vs what I want which is less moderation (cases of legal precedent + extra topic or so such as gross misinformation).

**Essentially, I think the current level/ amount of moderation is too high and it should be toned back a bit.**

>I believe once a social media network or app gets large enough, it should be regulated and treated as a public square

Here's the thing - what if a website being able to moderate some speech is part of what makes it able to grow in the first place?

Like, look at the rules for the subreddit you're posting in right now. They're far stricter than the rules you're suggesting websites should be forced to follow. But people post here because those rules create better discussions that are more enjoyable to participate in. I could come up with a thousand ways to make a website generally less pleasant to hold a discussion on without breaking any laws.

If websites rely on moderation for user growth, that creates a huge problem whenever their successful moderation allows the community to grow past whatever point makes a website whatever you decide is "large enough".
Because as we all know, 4chan is not a dense echo chamber and you can absolutely change those peoples minds with opposing beliefs.

Also, why is this a bad precedent that will lead to a slippery slope and not, like, actual governmental censorship of communists or whatever?

I don't understand the term "bear free speech absolutist," but the end of this quote marks you as very much not a free speech absolutist. Could you explain in more detail what you believe in general and why?
As an owner of a site, me banning people is an act of speech. If you are a free speech absolutist, why are you in favor of so many restrictions on speech?

Also, these are not public squares...you literally have to become a member to participate.
>I believe once a social media network or app gets large enough, it should be regulated and treated as a public square

You've got it backwards. The government just needs to create it's own social media network that can function as "the town square".

>The more you censor these communities and ideas, the more you get them congregating in areas that are dense echo chambers and the less likely you can change these peoples minds with opposing beliefs

You misunderstand the purpose of banning people. It's so that they *will* fuck off and join some echo chamber and leave the rest of us alone. I don't care to change anyone's mind about their bigotry or shittyness. I just want them to take it somewhere else.
People have rights. You don't get to stomp on someone else's rights to amplify your own. 

For example, I have the right to refuse you service at my business. I can do so for pretty much any reason outside of a handful of things (protected classes). This is called freedom of association. If you come into my business and start going on some rant about black people (as an example), I'm well within my rights to say "you know, I don't want you here." This is going to negatively impact my business for one thing, and I find it abhorrent and don't want to pay my money to support it. That's of course my choice.

It's my business. You're not entitled to my business. As for something like a social media site, you don't get to stomp on people's rights to amplify your speech. You being banned from reddit doesn't infringe your right to free speech. You can still say whatever you like, reddit is incapable of stopping you. You're not entitled to say whatever you like, however you like, wherever you like, using someone else's property/business so lots of people hear you. 

The idea that any of these social media sites are so big they're essentially a public square is also pretty absurd. There are a number of massive social media sites you can choose from. It's incredibly easy to make your own social media site in fact. There are probably thousands of sites that allow you to post and talk with others. Getting banned from Twitter does not prevent you from saying what you want to say.  

So, what are you saying we should do? Should Twitter be nationalized? Or are you saying that the government should simply come in and say "you're not allowed to curate your site anymore, you still have to pay for everything and if it harms your business that's all on you"? Many sites would inevitably collapse as they wouldn't be able to deal with the influx of shit like bots that they now need to tread very carefully around to avoid breaking the law. 

If you want the companies nationalized, do you think a government social media site would be popular?

Un-curated sites turn into dog shit really quickly. Seriously, really quickly. So, in the end we'd just be destroying websites because they're popular, while stomping on people's rights in an effort to amplify our own speech. That sounds horrible.
. . . ok, I was going to ignore this topic entirely because, let's face it, it's like beating a dead horse by now. There's so many conversations online about "free speech" that you can find just about any perspective if you look long enough. (Related: are you familiar with r/FreeSpeech or any of the other subs with a similar name?)

but the more I try to walk away, the more I want to understand your position. You had my attention before; now, you have my curiosity. So let's try some questions:

>I’m personally a near free speech absolutist and I believe once a social media network or app gets large enough, it should be regulated and treated as a public square (where the only type of speech that can be censored but more so held legally liable are slander, threats of violence and whatever is prosecutable by the law)

What do you mean by "free speech absolutist?" Can you provide an example of speech or personal expression that is simply unacceptable in any public setting? Or is it always contingent on the specific social standards at play?

What's your threshold of a "large enough" social media platform? How many users are we talking about? Or is it more about influence and effective reach? If so, how do we measure this?

What does it mean to "regulate" a social media platform? Who's doing the regulation? How should they decide what is and is not acceptable?

Which laws do you consider valid? If the United States passes a law that says you can't say "God damn it" on Reddit dot com, do you consider that an acceptable form of censorship simply because it's a law? If you don't, then what's the standard by which we judge our laws as appropriate or not?

>I’ve noticed more and more (especially on Reddit) deleted comments everywhere, communities shut down that are increasingly more tame (2balkan4you).

This sounds like a form of bias, though I can't recall the proper name, something about how having a narrow view of a bigger picture leads one to draw the wrong conclusions. In other words, just because *you* notice something, doesn't mean it's necessarily a trend or indicative of a larger social change. Do you have any data that backs up the implication that Reddit is becoming more restrictive (in terms of one's freedom to post whatever they want)?

>The more you censor these communities and ideas, the more you get them congregating in areas that are dense echo chambers and the less likely you can change these peoples minds with opposing beliefs.

Who is the "you" in this sentence? Who is doing the censoring? Who is being censored? And are we certain that this characterization is accurate? Is it possible that what you're seeing is simply better moderation from groups of people who are keenly aware of what they're willing to tolerate in their members' behavior?

(*more to follow, I'm sure, but this will suffice for a start . . .*)
