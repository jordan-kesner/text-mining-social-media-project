Title: AOC: “We are seeing Cubans rise up and protest for their rights like never before. We stand in solidarity with them, and we condemn the anti-democratic actions led by President Diaz-Canel. The suppression of the media, speech and protest are all gross violations of civil rights.”

She opposes the brutality of the Cuban regime, while also opposing the negative impact the embargo has had on the Cuban people. This is essentially my position, the embargo is universally opposed throughout the world and has in all likelihood strengthened the regime by isolating them from the Cuban ex-pat community.
“The suppression of the media, speech and protest are all gross violations of civil rights”.

Yeah u rite AOC. That definitely doesn’t happen over here.
I think what’s going on in Cuba is multilayered. They are protesting authoritarianism not a necessary component to communism. The reason I say that is because you don’t see them chanting “replace communism with capitalism” you instead hear them chant for freedom.
