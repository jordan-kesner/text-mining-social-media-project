Title: How bad do you believe big tech censorship is going to get?

Post:
I recently made a post for my campaign website on Facebook that was removed without notice. The only reason I can think of is that it is because I put a blog post of a Reddit post I made that was against vaccine mandates (either that or because I put that I'm Libertarian). This makes me wonder how far big tech censorship must go before more of the public starts to rise up against it.

Thoughts?

Idk. I just posted on FB about doing your mom. They let it go. If you donâ€™t like it, you can just delete Facebook
I fucking hate it. Reddit is like the last mainstream social I am ever using, most mainstream socials now are fucking data slurpers and censor a lot. I wish I could get my pc to run linux, and cut my ass off the spyware botnet that is the modern mainstream tech world.
Oh is that what you meant? She was all over the news a month ago or so. Google it and you'll see.
