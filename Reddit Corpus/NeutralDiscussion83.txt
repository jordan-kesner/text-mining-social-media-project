Living in Boston and I’m convinced we are going to go from 300 to 1k by Monday and 10k in the next 2-3 weeks. People went out for st pattys and I keep seeing a lot of old people walking around. Cases and fatalities still rookie numbers now compared to a couple weeks from now.
Mass layoffs at my job yesterday. This just a week after so many colleagues we’re saying I was overreacting about how serious this could get. I’ve been reduced from 40 hour a week to 8 starting Monday.
My wife is on the front lines in the Philippines at one of the largest hospitals there. The local restaurants are sending them free food and the hospital has set up a temporary accomodation where the nurses can rest. These nurses are working basically non stop and only go to the accommodation for sleep. No off days, no breaks. Work is immense and she told me even those people who used to be calm under pressure are breaking down from the stress. My wife is currently working 14-16 hour shifts. Things are not easy there.

Also the hospital is one of the largest in the Philippines (JCI accredited,) but they are still running out of stock for vital medical equipment like N95 masks and disposable shoe covers. It is an extremely bad situation which the govt doesn't show.

Please do not forget how healthcare workers put themselves on the line in this crisis. They are on the front lines protecting others from this horrible disease.

Also stock up on Vitamin C. She told me how COVID19 patients were getting Vit C by IV in large doses (6-18 grams per day) and its helping them a lot. The staff is also provided Vit C each day and instructed to take 4-6 grams daily spread out during their shift hours.
Good indication for how seriously this is being taken,
