Government Censorship is wrong, but Private Censorship is ok. The same people being butt hurt over this are the same ones reinforcing "conservative safe spaces" that ban or censor liberals (r/Conservative is a perfect example). 

They don't mind censorship. It's just that they don't want to be the ones censored.
Thank goodness. Researching WWII information regularly for wriiting purposes sometimes I would be linked to Neo Nazi sites, always gave me chills and made me feel like I was being watched by the fbi or immediately flagged for just stumbling on their wretched sites trying to do legitimate research.
I’m not trying to argue *for* 8chan, but if people simply started posting their pre-shooting manifestos on Facebook, would they shut that down?
