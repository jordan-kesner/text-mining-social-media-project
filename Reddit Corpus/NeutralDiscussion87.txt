this is the state of the US new today if ten people complain on twitter its a big story and will be on the nightly news in Baltimore. its sad that twitter and Facebook has become the go to source for the media in the USA.

Whole Foods should join the growing number of businesses that are finding it impossible to please their clientele in Baltimore, and just close their doors and leave.
Why?  the soldiers have to eat.  If they paid that is a lot of money they bring in.  If they didnt pay, It is very common for restaurants to give food to law enforcement officers as it encourages them to go in more often.

If my business was in Baltimore, I would much prefer the national guards troops being there over the looters
Woahhhh, what? Who the hell cares about where the troops get their sandwiches? that's just silly. How big is this "storm"? I can't imagine a horde of people giving a shit about this.
It ain't right that national guard soldiers should get sandwiches when we can't feed our kids because we done burned down the local supermarket
I don't like Whole Foods because of the whole anti-GMO bullshit, but this is ridiculous. And i agree with NCD75, a few people complaining on Twitter is not and should never be considered news.
