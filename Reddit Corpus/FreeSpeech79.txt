In which a panel of tech employees discuss their strategies in countering "disinformation" and how they determine what is "disinformation". This all sounds well and good, until you realize that in this video, they admit that the label of disinformation is often applied to things that are true.

Note that TNI is in my understanding an arm of the BBC, which is a state funded media company in my understanding. So if foreign state funded companies are coordinating big tech censorship, is that really acceptable to us?

Speaking to Americans in this sentiment, I know we are an international community.

So, these are the people who coordinated the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop in the 2020 election, it was labeled disinformation, while being true. I think I am within the rules of the sub posting this here, if this is judged by the mods to be not related to free speech, I understand.

Its tangentially related, I find it important to understand how this is being coordinated.

So I have been going through their website, they have large volumes of material on how to suppress information they don't like, with a bit of a focus on using this to alter the course of elections.

So, what they have no content on whatsoever is how to apologize and hold themselves accountable for their misteps, misdeeds, and the labeling of factual journalism as misinformation.

So my contention is, everyone needs to recognize that the arbiters of truth at TNI have a poor track record and no demonstrated ability to course correct or hold themselves accountable.
