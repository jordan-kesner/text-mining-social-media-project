"The court’s decision was swift and came down on the side of preserving online services’ current freedom to moderate — for now. But Democrats calling for companies to take down harmful content have to understand the urgency of what [still is](https://www.vox.com/2022/5/31/23149183/supreme-court-texas-social-media-ruling-netchoice-paxton) on the line.

Right now, online services can take down what’s known as “lawful but awful,” speech. If someone were to post a video of animal abuse on Facebook, Meta can delete it. If a Russian troll were to tweet out misinformation, Twitter could ban them and remove the content. And if someone were to post violent, white supremist content to YouTube, the platform could remove it. The content in terms of speech is legal, but removed by platforms to keep their communities healthy and inviting.

If Texas has its way, platforms would be barred from removing this content by making it illegal for platforms with more than 50 million monthly users from moderating posts based on “viewpoint.” But in the same way Congress can’t compel The New York Times to cover certain topics, Texas can’t compel social media companies to host certain kinds of speech.

The stakes here are very real. Meta announced last fall that it had removed over [20 million pieces of content](https://www.cnet.com/news/social-media/facebook-removed-more-than-20-million-posts-for-covid-19-misinformation/) from Facebook containing misleading information about COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. Democrats have called on companies to go even further, [introducing legislation](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/22/1019346177/democrats-want-to-hold-social-media-companies-responsible-for-health-misinformat) that would hold the social platforms themselves responsible for health-related misinformation on their platforms.

But proposals like the one in Texas would have expressly prevented companies from taking any action whatsoever to prevent misinformation posted by users. And while Republicans state legislators craft bills forcing platforms to carry vile content, the response from Democratic lawmakers in Congress has been missing.

Some progressive organizations have sounded the alarm. As the Supreme Court considered Texas’ new social media law, our organization, Chamber of Progress, led a coalition of groups opposing the legislation, including the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League as well as LGBT safety groups and child protection organizations. Progressives want to empower more content moderation, not less.

If Democratic lawmakers really want tech companies to moderate content and take down harmful content, now would be the time to speak up against Texas’ law.

Big questions about the future of free speech online will be answered in the coming year. The Texas case will return to the appellate court for a decision on the underlying law, and more [bills with similar intentions](https://twitter.com/ProgressChamber/status/1478787937663950854) will likely make their way through Republican legislatures. If allowed to pass, they will cripple the ability of tech platforms to prevent misinformation, violence and hate from spreading online.

Democratic leaders are right to continue pushing tech to do more to mitigate harmful content. But they also have to stand up for companies’ legal ability to do so — and firm opposition against GOP proposals like HB20 would be an important first step."

So, democrats really don't want us to have free speech online, they are fighting it tooth and nail.

Empower more content moderation is the term they are using. So, no more can they hide behind the lie that this is about companies rights, they are pushing for literal censorship directed by the state.

As is being documented right now by the GOP led publicization of the DHS attempt to operationalize public private partnerships. This lie that it's about misinformation is transparent and ridiculous, as they have been caught censoring, in an incomplete list, security concerns about Dominion, scientific studies about coronavirus, vaccines and alternative treatment, and factual news stories about Ashley Bidens diary and Hunter Bidens laptop, as well as literally censoring the CDC at times.

Democrats want you censored. They want to control the narrative through the union of state and corporate power, and use this control to uphold their failing Presidency, which is polling at record low numbers right now.

Don't think this will only be used against conservatives either. Dissenting left voices have been censored a lot also. Hell, we are the most censored. Right wing people have their echo chambers, they have truth social, there is no platform explicitly for dissenting left voices, vaccine critical BLM activists, antiwoke lgtbq voices, or many other movements with the democrats want censored while claiming to represent. This is pushing these voices toward the GOP, as they are our best hope to end the information blockade and liberate our digital town square.

We do not want democrats and the interests of multinational capital to decide what poor people are allowed to say, and we will win. This will have second order effects that will set the left back in the us, but the freedom of the people to speak in private spaces will allow the peoples narrative to emerge for the first time in history, on a large scale. There has never been a time where decentralized mass media gives more power to ordinary people, allowing us to determine the narrative free of the interests of publishers and their funding. Legislation to protect viewpoint has been introduced in over 30 states now and it is only a matter of time until we regulate big tech. That will be a resounding victory for working class people, historic and unprecedented. Anyone that agrees, please let your reps know.

Here is the federal legislation. On the page you will find a link to contact your reps and let them know what you think of the issue. Democrat reps especially need to hear from their constituency on this issue. Thanks for your consideration.

This is an analysis of the Hill in terms of Bias and ownership. They are a centrist publication targeting political thought leaders. They are founded by a Democrat and currently owned by his son.

" The Hill is owned by the [Capitol Hill publishing corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)). Capitol Hill Publishing Corporation is [a subsidiary of News Communications Incorporated](https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.news_communications_inc.0e22f64497a27eb6931eba7daa541de9.html). Jimmy Finkelstein is the [current CEO of New Communications](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/person/1705195). "

Ownership. So we can infer that the attempts to regulate social media to limit viewpoint discrimination are not in these organizations interest. Or they would be in favor.

The Democratic Party is the main purveyor of misinformation. No government should decide or control content, as they inevitably abuse their power.
The legislators who support this assume they will be able to control the agency that regulates what is allowable speech, and what isn’t, forever. It never works that way. 

If the house flips in the next election, as is widely expected, and if the White House flips is 2024, which is probably at least an even bet, the last thing the Democrats would want is for Republicans to control an agency that determines what speech is allowed. Imagine a board with this power where every member is appointed by Trump. 

Political parties need to stop ruling on the basis of “what’s good for me today”, and start thinking about “what’s good for everyone in the long run”.
People need to realize how Corrupt the US government really is and why we need terms on those fuckers. People need to realize what is really at stake, free speech and freedom, or have your dam rights taken away.

/u/BearClaw5, your submission was removed by reddit's spam filter, and I had to approve it manually.

One of those links is probably disliked by the filter.
/u/bearclaw5, I have found an error in your post:

 > “lie that ~~its~~ [**it's**] about misinformation”

To me, it appears you, bearclaw5, intended to type “lie that ~~its~~ [**it's**] about misinformation” instead. ‘Its’ is possessive; ‘it's’ means ‘it is’ or ‘it has’.

 ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs!)
Daily reminder that getting banned for saying all trans people are child molesters isn’t censorship. I know some of you need to hear that.
