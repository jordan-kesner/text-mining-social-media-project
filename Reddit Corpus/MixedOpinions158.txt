Title: CMV: The only logically way to reconcile the abortion debate is to admit that abortion ends a human life, but also that protection of human life is not always the primary concern of the law.

Post:
I'm pro-choice, but I also think that the traditional talking points on both sides completely ignore those on the other side. 

The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes "a person" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.

That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.

You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, "Ehhh, but we like to go fast."

But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?

You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail.

Arguing that there _other places where we fail to save lives_ is not an argument for adding another, or sustaining another. That's like saying "there is evil in the world so we should be OK with more evil".  

The bodily autonomy position embeds your argument - the interest of preserving ones right to expel things from inside their body that they don't want there trumps a concern about the sanctity of the life the fetus that happens to be inside you.  It subordinates the life of the fetus to an idea that our rights to control our body are more important the life.

How is conception not just another one out of many arbitrary points various parties have proposed?

I'd agree that at conception, the clump of cells can be shown to be *alive* and *of human origin*, but that does not make them "a human life", "a person", or anything like that. The latter two are loaded terms and depend on how we define what a human life is in the first place, and that is necessarily arbitrary.

I agree with the rest of your post, and I believe that bodily integrity should be decisive, not personhood or humanness or any such wishy-washy term.
The good thing about choosing "viability" as the breaking point is that is makes clear what the actual boundary is:

You don't get to use another person's body against their will, and if stopping you requires killing you, so be it. 

However, if something less than lethal force can effectively be used, it must be.

It's not at all pointless.

There's more to this issue than human life-if it's not a human life than it's part of a woman's body.

So if it's a life it's a murder issue, if it's not then it's a women's rights issue.

I think that this is why abortion is one of if not the most difficult political issues. To a person who feels that life begins at conception a pro-choicer is a endorsing murder. To a person who disagrees the pro-lifer is violating a woman's right to her own body.

We weigh risk versus reward.

So let's throw out speed limits and abortion and look at the concept of fighting.

We allow sports like MMA and boxing because the risk of injury, while high, can be offset by regulations and standards.

We don't allow pistol duels, however, because the risk shoots up beyond a point where regulations can properly control.

So higher speed limits assume risk but we offset that with safety technology, vehicle inspection, DWI laws and police presence.

We can't control for risk in an abortion. The risk is very nearly 100%-the goal is to end the pregnancy.

Now I'm pro choice so obviously I don't take the pro life view. But I don't believe that the comparison you're making really helps the debate-very few people would endorse activity that guarantees the death of a child.

I don't think it would help at all to resolve the debate, because a lot of pro-abortion campaigners *do* acknowledge that a human life begins at conception, and that the abortion kills a developing human being - but the debate goes on, because the anti-abortion campaigners believe that the developing human must be protected from being killed.
I am not sure you can reconcile the abortion debate with this view. This is exactly the reasoning in the opinion in the Roe v. Wade decision, and I would argue that RvW kickstarted the debate into high gear rather than do anything to reconcile the views. Roe v. Wade discusses the "is it a person" question but abandons that question as being unanswerable. Instead it presupposes that yes it is a person (for the sake of argument) and then argues that the rights of the mother pre-viability must take precedence over the rights of the fetus, even its right to life. That what you are saying isn't it?
You should look up the vagueness fallacy.

Basically, the fallacy is claiming that because there is no distinct dividing line between two states, the two states do not exist (or are not logically distinguishable)

Classic examples are baldness and clouds. 

You are committing a vagueness fallacy here with your life claim.
"The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes "a person" is pointless.

Logic doesn't come into it.  It's a matter of definition, not logic.  Any definition is somewhat arbitrary, whether you choose conception, viability, birth, or some other arbitrary dividing line.  For example, why is birth so important from a legal perspective?  That's a modern assumption.  Many if not most human cultures practiced some form of infanticide under certain conditions (malformed infants being perhaps the most common, but also undesirable children or children with undesirable characteristics were frequently abandoned or killed).  In many historical cultures, the commission of a crime against an infant was a different sort of offense compared to a child of a certain age who might be able to walk and talk.  At some point children were essentially endowed with "full human" rights under those legal codes, again under a somewhat arbitrary definition.

Of course, it's not completely arbitrary -- any definition makes certain assumptions.  The position that you advocate seeks to treat a fertilized egg as a "full human," which may seem most "logical" to you, but would have seemed bizarre to perhaps most human cultures throughout history.  Viability makes the assumption that what matters is the ability to survive outside the mother.  Why is that less arbitrary just because it can change with technology?  You seem only to adopt it because it makes your legal conundrum about abortion simpler to deal with, rather than having to handle multiple cases.  But that's perhaps the most arbitrary (and illogical) reason for adopting a definition -- not for any reason having to do human values in resolving an ethical conundrum, but just to make your syllogisms easier to resolve??

Birth is yet another milestone, though perhaps even more arbitrary than viability given modern medicine that can induce or control the time of birth.  And what of the standards of other societies that did not afford full adult rights to infants or even small children?  There were rationales for such legal division points too: often the appearance of "human" characteristics like walking or talking... or later on the ability to reason (often taken to be around age 7-8).  We still have such arbitrary division points to decide legal status: when a person is "adult" enough to consent to sex or marriage or various other things, when a person is "adult" enough to vote or drink, etc.

These all tended to vary historically and thus are cultural rather than logical constraints, though they generally have some broad justification.  So, while your method of resolving your argument may be one POSSIBLE logical way of dealing with the issue, it is certainly not the ONLY "logical" possibility, depending on the assumptions behind the definition of "life" or "human rights" or whatever.
I disagree that conception is only place we can define as the start of human life. About 30% of all zygotes fail to implant.
