 Corporations have been censoring everything that goes against their interests for years, and there's no point in talking about censorship in government, it's been obvious for a long time. Therefore, in my opinion, we need more independent and decentralized media, which, like Solcial for example, would not suppress freedom of speech, but on the contrary, would give voice to anyone who wants it.
That's bizarre.  You would think google would love to push the 1619 project.  as with any counterfactual wacky conspiracy theory, the 1619 BS should be allowed to be shown so it can be mocked and destroyed like the revisionist history it is.
