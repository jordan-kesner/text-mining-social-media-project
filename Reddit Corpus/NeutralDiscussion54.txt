Title: With today's culture wars now including the framing of "Parent's Rights", how much control *should* a parent have over their underaged child's life?

Post:
I should say at the top that I'm mostly interested to hear the thoughts of actual parents in this, as I am not one yet. I think this matter is a case where parents have the most to add to the conversation as it touches on their lives and values, but their views of it also need to be weighed as being too close to the issue and biased. Parents want to protect their kids, but how much protection is too much?

Anyway, one part of the modern culture wars that I feel like hasn't garnered a lot of discussion in the wake of the various "anti-woke"/"Don't Say Gay" bills over the last two years has been the expectation that the parent's role in the child's life has become more all-encompassing than it was a generation or two ago. In the last year, we've seen bills described as "Parent's Rights" bills [sweeping the country](https://www.future-ed.org/legislative-tracker-parent-rights-bills-in-the-states/), empowering parents to monitor the curriculum, reading materials, and interactions with staff that their children are experiencing at school and empowering them to raise objections to material they disagree with that are backed with legal weight. This has mostly been in the context of schools teaching material that the Right has objected to, framed as "Critical Race Theory" or the teaching of "sexually explicit material" to children. This issue was a major part of the VA governor's race in 2021, such that Terry McAuliffe's infamous gaffe, [“I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach”](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/578885-education-blunder-igniting-suburban-parents-driving-mcauliffe-panic-in/), may have been the final nail in the coffin on his campaign. Likewise, [this year has seen a major rise in "parent's rights" groups pushing for book bans to be enacted in schools, particularly on works with a focus on race or sexuality](https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/), limiting the ability of students to exercise autonomy in educating themselves on topics their parents may disapprove of. So where should we draw the line on where the authority of a parent to raise their children in a manner they see fit ends?

These bills also empower parents to be informed on changes to their students lives in school without the approval of the student. To quote [the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act](https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022/1557/BillText/er/PDF):

>In accordance with the rights of parents enumerated in ss. 1002.20 and 1014.04, adopt procedures for notifying a student's parent if there is a change in the student's services or monitoring related to the student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being and the school's ability to provide a safe and supportive learning environment for the student. The procedures must reinforce the fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding the upbringing and control of their children by requiring school district personnel to encourage a student to discuss issues relating to his or her well-being with his or her parent or to facilitate discussion of the issue with the parent. The procedures may not prohibit parents from accessing any of their student's education and health records created, maintained, or used by the school district, as required by s. 1002.22(2). 

This is often cited by critics as *requiring* teachers to out LGBT students that may have confided in them to their parents, though particularly with regards to trans students using a different name and gender than they were enrolled under. Because the bill also empowers parents to threaten schools with legal action if staff members refuse to comply, then the students can no longer trust teachers or counselors to be adult confidants they can turn to outside of their family, cutting off an arm of social support that students have had access to in the past. How much should a parent be able to know about their children versus how much privacy and autonomy should a child be able to have?

And this isn't just limited to schools, the medical rights of children are also largely left in the hands of parents to decide. This isn't particularly new, [there have been multiple cases of children dying preventable deaths of illnesses that could have been treated if not for the religious objections of the parents](http://childrenshealthcare.org/?page_id=132) for over a century, from Christian Science to Jehovah's Witnesses to Orthodox Judaism. [43 states have laws protecting parents from neglect charges in those situations](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/parents-beliefs-about-medicine-child-abuse#State-laws-vary-on-religious-exemptions). But as anti-vaccine sentiment has become more widespread, [especially in the wake of the post-pandemic culture wars](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/12/26/vaccine-hesitancy-measles-chickenpox-polio-flu/), we've seen [tragic resurfacing of illnesses like polio and measles](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/29/polio-us-vaccines-new-york-rockland-county), where the children of parents who hold anti-vax views have their health put in risk with no say in the matter. [In most of the country, minors are not able to consent to vaccination without the approval of their parents](https://theconversation.com/do-us-teens-have-the-right-to-be-vaccinated-against-their-parents-will-it-depends-on-where-they-live-166147). This year has also seen stories of trangender teenagers seeking access to, or information about, puberty blockers or hormone treatments without their parents' knowledge through social media, [raising alarm among conservative parents](https://nypost.com/2021/06/09/lunatic-laws-let-gender-radicals-deny-all-parental-rights/). Similarly, while the last decade has seen significant progress to [have conversion therapy for minors labeled as child abuse and banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._jurisdictions_banning_conversion_therapy), it still remains legal in half of the country. In all of those cases, the parents aren't the ones who have to live with the consequence of the decisions they make on behalf of their child, the child is. So how much should _their_ opinions weigh in on what they want to have done with their health and their bodies?

"[Think of the children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3D8670smTI)" action is [nothing new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_trial), but the new framing of the issue has in some ways moved away from "protecting children" and more around "parents' rights", and that raises the question for me of how far those rights _should_ extend. No one likes the idea of the government telling families how to raise their kids because parents are, ostensibly, acting in what they consider to be the best interests of their children, and no way to raise a child is one-size-fits-all. You can even make good faith arguments to Left-leaning parents that these expansions of parental rights _can_ be used to monitor their children and allow for interventions to protect their kids if they show signs of self-harm, or radicalization, or sexual exploitation, which makes the argument of expanded parental rights appealing to them too. Yet as parental oversight has expanded since the days of "Stranger Danger" and away from the free-range ([sometimes _actually dangerous_](https://www.generations.com/insights/gen-x-on-the-edge-surviving-childhood)) childhoods of older Millennials and Gen Xers, we're seeing [concerning rates of mental health issues](https://healthmatch.io/blog/the-gen-z-mental-health-wave-what-is-causing-the-surge) among Gen Z that may be tied to [growing up in environments dominated by helicopter parents and limited in personal autonomy that weakens their emotional resiliency](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60624/young-adults-are-struggling-with-their-mental-health-is-more-childhood-independence-the-answer). So where do we draw the lines on where a parent's control over their child ends and a child becomes an autonomous person with their own rights? How do we as a culture get parents to build trust with their children and relax control over their lives? Is that something we even should be doing, or should parents be able to shape their child's life around their personal beliefs? Is this something that the government should even be legislating, either more rights to parents or more freedoms to children?

I am one of the parents that believe that children should have 100% access to books what ever the title is. Im so confident on the values i have tought my kids, that I am 100% sure they will be able to navigate life and books with no problem even if controversial. I also believe that children should have access to all kinds of information. Information is power. 

The only thing i banned was social media until they were 14. Specially snap chat, as ive seen so much drama unfold on that app, that for their safety i told them no and why no. We love to have great conversations with my kids about different things.

Also if you don’t educate your kids with proper values society will do, that is why there are prisons…..Therefore the state will take over educating your kids if you don’t….


Edit: Lol at the downvotes and also to all the “but what about gender queer” people below: Most of the schools with that book are HIGhSCHoOLs.   And its parents of high schools students wanting that book gone…….apparently it puts a hurt on their morals.
As a parent, I know fuck all about medicine, I am not a teacher and I also don’t know about many other things that will ultimately impact my child’s life. However, the same way I trust in a mechanic to fix my car, I trust professionals to fill the gaps in my child’s life. As such, I shouldn’t be able to withhold essential medical treatment for my child because I saw a YouTube video on nano bots and if I want to teach my child at home, I should be assessed to make sure I am neither neglectful nor a total moron. Anything else is harmful to the child.
Everything boils down to informed uncoerced competent consent.

My children (at their current ages) are not competent enough at their current ages / mental maturity to do a great many things (play with matches, get tattoos, buy a house, examples ad hyperbole etc)

Until they are able to 1. Be fully (as possible) informed or provided with the appropriate information to make a decision, 2. Are under no duress for the decision (i.e. someone is threatening them. Etc) 3. Are mentally competent enough to understand the ramifications of their decisions,  and 4. Willingly want to do something after all factors are weighed.

It is my job as a parent to take those decisions on. 

This will be interpreted different in many households. But the parents should be the ones ultimately responsible for their children's well being.

That being said, as the child matures they gain more autonomy. How much is difficult based on the individual. My daughter for instance is extremely independent. Not distant or removed, but she definitely makes a large amount of her own decisions, whereas my younger son cannot.

This is an area with so much Grey that making universal rules is almost impossible. Which is why, I think, society defaults to "until they're an adult the parents rule ".
Parents scream "indoctrination" at schools.....all the while indoctrinating the shit out of their own kids.  When students project crazy attitudes at school, it's 99% learned from their parents.  Signed, An exhausted teacher
If you want full control of your child, then you need to homeschool them. By dictating that your child can't learn X Y or Z you are taking X Y & Z away from my child and other people's children.  I don't want my child's education to be stunted because someone else is a bigot and/or a homophobe. 

Why does YOUR limited world view have to be my child's problem?
I find it really telling how these pushes for “parents’ rights” in schools both 1) really glorify ignorance, and 2) only apply to parents who fit a very specific social and political mould. Nobody going to a school board meeting to scream about parental rights seems to give a shit that a lot of other parents would really like their kids to get a comprehensive education, including on LGBTQ+ topics. 

Parents shouldn’t get to keep their kids in perpetual ignorance in an effort to ensure that their kids never develop opinions that may contradict their parents.
Parents should understand the difference between protection and control. I can teach my kid to watch for cars crossing the road, for a while I can require him to hold my hand to cross, but eventually I'm not going to be there and he's either going to look or not and get hit by a car or not. I can try to protect him and for a while I can try to control him, but ultimately he is the only one in control of himself. That can be extrapolated to any belief/concept. Eventually, the parent is not going to be there and these Parental Bills of Rights are trying to allow the parent to control those moments too by using teachers and librarians as proxy parents. (It's so ironic to me when people in favor of these "rights" point out that teachers aren't parents. Of course they're not and that's why they aren't responsible for controlling your child the way you want them controlled.) It's just not possible and it's ridiculous that we have politicians pretending it is. I think any parent trying to control every aspect of their child's life is some form of abuse and we've seen real cases of this that have harmed and even killed children.
