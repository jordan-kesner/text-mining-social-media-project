There are only two correct approaches. 


Give a lot of advance notice. Amazon did this in many cases. 'We are closing this team in 2 months, wrap up your work, if you can find a transfer we will approve it, if not you'll have 3 months severance."


Option 2 again just be transparent. "We are doing layoffs. We are sorry but your position has been removed. Here is your package if any"

*Layoffs in the first month of 2024 have left tens of thousands without jobs, with the tech industry alone cutting 32,000 roles.*

*The way the bad news is delivered is more important than ever, as companies fear being canceled on social media after a poorly executed final conversation.*

*Executives are using all kinds of euphemisms to avoid being straightforward with their employees.*

*In early December, Spotify Technology SA opted for the term “right-sized” in its letter announcing job cuts.*

*At Meta Platforms Inc., Mark Zuckerberg referred to “org changes” in a lengthy memo that included an array of personnel shifts at the company, including job losses.*

*Citigroup Inc.’s statement in November referenced a “simplified operating model” to describe its plans to cut 20,000 jobs.*

*Harvard Business School professor Sandra Sucher said that delicate language is the result of “moral disengagement,” a harm-doer’s effort to rationalize and soften the action for themselves.*

*Ultimately, the meaning is the same to the worker: They’re losing their job.*
Oh man, I almost burst out laughing on my Company Town Hall Teams call when one guy asked, “So a lot of people are going to be ‘impacted’, but *is anybody going to be laid off?*”
Shareholder bonuses

Executive bonuses

They’ll keep gutting the middle class until there’s no more money to be wrung out. 

What comes after that has been seen throughout history.
