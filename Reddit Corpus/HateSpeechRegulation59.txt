there's no such thing as hate speech in US law.  the question here is how and to what extent *threats* can be punished.
To use an argument from the gun control crowd: the founding fathers never intended for citizens to have high speed mass communication devices capable of spreading their messages quickly and easily. The first amendment was meant to protect printed words and spoken word only. It's time to pass common sense legislation to get these unregistered mass communication devices off the street. 
I think we need to define "reasonable person" better. I mean, there are over 3 Million citizens in the USA still on dialup. I bet most of those people never even heard of twitter. And these are the "reasonable people"? 

We need better standards for this, it is the internet, the world of anonymous people. Things get set, and in chat, there is no "voice". 

And in a song? 

I think actually Eminem was onto something with that song.

I think the song is called "Criminal"
Yeah, I was just rambling about this point earlier.

Oh well, I'll have an AK-47 that I would've never had before soon enough so I suppose they've accomplished what they wanted.
FTR, here's the litigants lyrics:

> And when I come to court this better be the last time. I’m not kidding at all, I’m making this video public. ‘Cause if I have to kill a judge or a lawyer or a woman I don’t care.
Words have overthrown governments. Words convinced people to join the Jamestown cult and kill themselves and their children. Words have incited nations to commit acts of war and genocide. Words have incited people to riot and destroy property. Words have incited people to commit hate crimes. 

Don't give me the bullshit that words can't be dangerous.
