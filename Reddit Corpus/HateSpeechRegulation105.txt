These kinds of terms, along with any kind of arbitrary additions without user base consultations. should be prohibited by law.
So then, if Adobe is engaging in content moderation of active projects by their users, then they're legally liable for any criminal actions (like fake pictures and misinformation) created by those projects that slips through, right?
Holy shit hahahah


Microsoft Recall, Adobe content moderation...


Next up will be camera implants in our eyes to fine us for looking at the wrong thing
In the EU is already illegal for instagram to force users into accepting their AI thing. 

Guess Adobe will follow suit.
