They just cannot help themselves from being dirtbags. They truly can't. Lmao

If there's an Adobe mass exodus I swear I'm gonna \*checks what sub I'm in\* uhhh need new pants
Damn there are so many Adobe apologists in this thread. Adobe has said nothing to put anyone at ease. Their last ToS was deplorable and disgusting yet all of you are defending them like their next update is going to somehow magically change their tune towards their users, as if they suddenly acquired a soul.

They said they are addressing their claims about training AI on your data, but that still begs the question if they will be viewing and moderating your content
Woah it’s NDA breach season my dude. Lot of motion picture concept art and model texture is done on photoshop and most of those job come with NDA so people working on it don’t go around showing spoiler stuff. And who know how secure is where adobe keep all those ToS acquired content
I should have canceled like 3 or 4 months ago when I was originally thinking about doing it, but this was the final step in pushing me to cancel my subscription.
When Adobe announced all this cloud subscription nonsense I boycotted their new products for personal use and made myself transition to less powerful alternatives. It hurt a bit then. Feels fantastic now. What a bunch of shit.
