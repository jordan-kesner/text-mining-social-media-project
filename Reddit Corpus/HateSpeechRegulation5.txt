>Right or wrong, protecting the rights of some, or infringing upon the rights of others, the trolls that lead the closing of Memories Pizza’s made online free speech and expression activists look childish. The internet doesn’t have to be a tool for hate – the more these situations happen and permeate the national conversation about the many hats the internet wears, the less seriously we’ll be taken. And that friends, bums me out. ‪

>Yelp can absolutely remove the trolls’ comments under their ToS agreement. They’re left in between a rock and a hard place though:

>If Yelp pulls the comments (which legally they can, and often do by “not recommending the review for other users”) they’re being tough on discriminatory speech online but might appear to be silencing critics of the RFRA, violating generally accepted boundaries of free speech online. This calls into question how we define which spaces are in fact public online (Sauter, 14).

>However, if Yelp actively leaves the comments up, they’re taking a stance on the RFRA and setting a precedent that users can troll to their anonymous collective heart’s desire.
