Title: CMV: No matter how good the intentions are behind it, no restriction of free speech is a good idea.

Post:
Now, I should note that this primarily focuses on hate speech laws, but anything really in this sense can apply. Let's get started.

CLARIFICATION: I'm primarily speaking about laws preventing the expression of beliefs, primarily politically.

ANOTHER CLARIFICATION: I'm speaking about laws akin to hate speech laws, not like, the promotion of crime, etc.

Context:
Recently I've been in an on-and-off argument with a close friend over hate speech laws. Her argument is that hate speech laws do more good than harm as they protect targeted minorities, and prevent the spread of racist and/or otherwise opinions. Part of her argument is also that if I support hate speech, why do I believe it should be legal?

I should make it brutally clear, I'm not a minority in any senses other than that I'm transgender and lesbian. However, I wouldn't make my opinion a double standard even if it was attacking me.

My belief:
The right to free speech should in no way be impeded or changed. Now, I believe this for a couple of key reasons:

- More pro-free-speech oriented
    - Giving away any right to the government, for any reason, cannot be taken back. Imagine if we handed away the fourth amendment. The cops could barge in any old time without reason.
    - Giving the right to silence permanently opens the door to government-sponsored censorship.
        - As such, by giving the power to do so to the government, you inherently put it into the hands of "the wrong person" (Someone with the intent to silence other opinions, regardless of theirs).
    - A society without truly free expression will be like a twenty-five year old kept in a sterile room their entire life -- The common cold will leave them deathly ill. What I'm trying to say is, if society is never exposed to differing arguments, said differing arguments will spread like the plague.
    - People who are silenced always speak louder than their silencer, meaning that ideas will spread quicker, and likely "underground". Limiting free speech will inherently bring a new free thought renaissance.

- More specific arguments against hate speech laws
    - I've seen absolutely no evidence in any arguments supporting these that they curb the tide of hate speech. Hell, even in Europe where hate speech laws are rampant, identitarian movements and other hate-based beliefs are growing exponentially.
    - What is determined as profane and offensive is extremely situational, and as such, there's no proper way to parameterize it. What I'm trying to say here is that a specific ruling will either bring in a lot of false-positives, or will create a lot of false-negatives. Too restricted speech will silence the incorrect people, too lax will let hate speech run free.
        - A recent example of a false-positive would be Count Dankula, the dude who taught his dog to perform the Nazi salute. This sounds bad, but in reality, he was performing a baseline juxtaposition for the sake of comedy. It's extremely unlikely he actually believes in Nazism.
    - You cannot get rid of hate speech laws once you have them. _After all, wouldn't removing them be siding with hate speech?_
    - Again, if the wrong people get this power, there is strong potential the table will be flipped, and say, your very own views will get silenced.
    - Hate speech laws based off offense will bring in more false positives than anything. Anyone can get offended at anything rather easily. It'll be the witch hunts all over again.

- More specific arguments against her argument
    - The ability for hateful opinions to be expressed is a small price to pay to ensure I will forever be allowed to express mine.
    - My support of the legality of an activity does not inherently mean I support the practice myself. 

Now, I don't personally agree with or support hate speech. But, I don't care how vile and insensitive your opinion may be. I might not support it or agree with it, but by god, I'll defend your right to say it until the end of days, as I expect the same courtesy.

Are you familiar with the paradox of tolerance? 

Basically what it states is that a society that is 100% tolerant of all opinions will eventually be taken over by a belief system that is inherently intolerant (by sheer mathematical probability) thus turning a previously tolerant society into an intolerant one.
According to the guy that first formulated this idea (Karl Popper) the only way for a tolerant society to remain tolerant is to be intolerant towards intolerance, which is paradoxical and therefore makes little sense intuitively (to me anyway) but it does logically.
I worry you're setting too high a standard: that, unless hate speech laws forever eradicate hate, they don't have good impacts.  But the question you should be asking isn't "Do people still hate in countries with hate speech laws?" it's "Is there less hate speech overall in countries with hate speech laws in the contexts protected by the hate speech laws, compared to what would be true without the hate speech laws?"  And... yes, obviously.

> Giving away any right to the government, for any reason, cannot be taken back.

This does not appear to be true, and I'm actually a bit concerned I'm misunderstanding you.  Laws change often.  Legal rulings interpreting laws change often.  *The constitution* has changed relatively often.  

> What is determined as profane and offensive is extremely situational, and as such, there's no proper way to parameterize it. 

This is true for all laws.  An entire branch of our government is dedicated to exactly this problem.  There's nothing unique here about hate speech laws.


> Again, if the wrong people get this power, there is strong potential the table will be flipped, and say, your very own views will get silenced.

I'm actually a bit bewildered about how they'd do this.  How could your typical hate speech law get twisted around?  If a government wanted to restrict an entirely different kind of speech, they'd just make a new law (or enforce it unofficially) rather than twisting around an old one.  I can't even really picture how this would work.  Could you tell me how this works, ideally using text from a real hate-speech law?


> Hate speech laws based off offense will bring in more false positives than anything. Anyone can get offended at anything rather easily. It'll be the witch hunts all over again.

Similarly, here, I'm very confused what you think these laws are.  You appear to think they're just "You can't say anything that offends anyone!" and... yeah, that seems pretty easy to misuse.  But what are you basing this on?


Generally, the arguments in favor of these laws take a wider scope than the one you're taking.  Essentially, there are many reasons someone might not express an opinion, despite having the right to.  They might be busy trying to find good work.  They might be beaten down and depressed.  They might not have enough social power for anyone to hear them.  They might literally be dead.

When a whole class of people is in danger of being in these situations... *because of ideas being spread by others*... then that's unjust.  That's a class of people with no voice.  In other words, hate speech laws are a trade-off that maximizes the extent to which MEANINGFUL free speech exists throughout society.
Saying there's a bomb on an airplane when there isn't can create serious panic and potentially get someone killed. Intentionally inciting panic is not something that is good to do and can result in some serious negative consequences. I do know that you say you're talking about mainly hate speech, but you also state that your belief is in reference to all speech.
Some actually are good. 

Intentionally saying something false to induce public panic being illegal is good "Yelling fire in a crowded theater". 

Slander and Libel laws to protect you from false statements used to destroy your reputation and livelihood are good.

So most of the arguments have been either hypothetical situations or concerns about the arguments you made about tyrannical governments. I agree with some other posters that you're a bit excessively concerned about government overreach - laws (and interpretations thereof) change *constantly*, and not necessarily always for the slightly worse. But I'm mainly going to talk about political philosophy here, so hopefully this is different from the responses you've gotten so far.

What is the political philosophical argument for free speech? There are two very distinct reasons why we might like free speech, but people often get them confused. The first is an ethical reason: we think it's right that people get a say in laws which they are subject to. This is fairly uncontroversial. The second is practical: free speech will improve the knowledgeability of the voting public and therefore improve the quality of decisions voters make. This last point is only made by proponents of a specific type of democracy called [deliberative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy). 

One of the simplest political philosophical arguments against unlimited free speech is to simply ask whether unlimited free speech actually does make the voting public more knowledgable or not. Because remember, it's a practical and empirical claim, not an ethical one. So while we all *want* to let people have a say in the laws they're subject to, letting everyone have a say in the laws they're subject to might make those laws worse, or better sometimes and worse other times. We have to investigate the world using the tools available to political scientists and political philosophers to determine what the practical consequences of unlimited free speech actually are.

As it happens, the actual practical usefulness of unlimited public debate is not uncontroversial among political philosophers. Unfortunately I haven't been a student in quite a while so I don't have journal access and I don't remember the contents of these papers super well, but two texts I would strongly recommend reading if you can find copies are I M Young's [Activist Challenges to Deliberative Democracy](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0090591701029005004) and Lynn M Sanders [Against Deliberation](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0090591797025003002).

I'm sorry I can't do more than throw links at you, but I'm really not confident enough in my memory of these texts to paraphrase them for you. So instead I'd like to ask a hypothetical question based on the arguements made in these (and other) papers: what if unlimited free speech leads to less informed and therefore inferior decisions by the voting public? We might then want to find ways to *partially* restrict free speech such that deliberative spaces reliably contribute to - rather than detract from - voter education and rationality. 

Now, you might argue that that represents a restriction of freedom, but I would counter by saying a) more informed voters will improve the lives of citizens of a democracy, even those who find their views curtailed and b) I am not advocating any restrictions on *voting* itself, only on the public expression of certain views which only serve to misinform. We still have a democracy if everyone can vote and *most* views can be expressed, we just don't have a dogmatic adherence to *deliberative* democracy. At the very least, even if you prefer unlimited free speech to optimal voting outcomes, you would have to agree that pursuit of optimal voting outcomes is a decent argument in favour of restrictions on free speech.

Edit: I've just remembered that Miranda Fricker's [Epistemic Injustice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Epistemic-Injustice-Power-Ethics-Knowing/dp/0199570523/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1526297813&sr=8-1&keywords=epistemic+injustice) is an interesting book that deals with these themes as well, if anyone is interested enough to buy a book about this stuff.
Canada has freedom of expression not free speech. You can't advocate harm to anyone even non specific, as the individual right to peace and safety trumps the rights of the speakers.

We like it a lot
Soliciting an illegal activity is speech that would otherwise be free if not for the restrictions placed on it \(the person soliciting isn't otherwise committing a crime\).  An example that fits your criteria of "expressing a belief": a voter from `party X` soliciting the assassination of a political figure from `party Y`.
While I agree with you that free speech should ideally be an untouchable right, the very nature of free speech allows it to dwindle, should a majority of people be okay/support it happening.

Free speech, by definition, includes speech promoting the limitation of free speech. Should these anti-free speech gain enough traction, it becomes only natural that the principle that supported it leads to its own demise.

The principle of free speech in itself includes the possibility of limiting free speech. That's what makes it a great freedom.

I think it's true to say that free speech has been historically very hard to obtain. Yet by its very nature it can be restricted, out of the very freedom it gives people.

So ultimately, if a majority of people allow free speech to be limited, it is their right and we should just accept it. Even if the net loss is probably much greater than the perceived gains (because limiting hate speech also limit the possibility of arguing against it, therefore people might become even more entrenched in their current views, should they be that you can't let haters speak openly or that your hate views are valid because unchallenged).
