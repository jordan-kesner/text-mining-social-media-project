Tonight is the night of the first of the 2020 General Election debates in Cleveland, Ohio at Case Western Reserve University and will be hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates and moderated by Chris Wallace.

##When?

Tonight, 29 September 2020 from 9PM Eastern for an hour and a half until 10:30PM, commercial-free. When this post is **9 hours old** the debate will be underway.

##Where?

Cleveland, Ohio! But also broadcast on channels including CNN, Fox News, CBS, ABC, C-SPAN, NBC and MSNBC. The debate will be streamed by ABC/CBS and CSPAN on YouTube, as will Google itself live stream the debate.


##Who?

Some guy named Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr and a relatively unkonwn individual named President Donald J Trump will be in attendance, as well as around 70 socially distant guests in the audience, and some dude named Chris Wallace.


##Why?

These guys are running for President of the United States for the election in November! They're going to tell us their opinions on issues facing the nation and be asked questions by the moderator to which they will respond with answers, ideally.

##Who else will be there?

Probably some camera crews and lighting/set designers but nobody else has qualified for the debates.

##Who won't be there?

Most people!

##Why are you posting this?

We had great threads for most debates during the primary that featured some lovely conversation; and furthermore our unique community fosters a particular brand of level-headed speech and debate that makes watching these events with you lot a legitimate pleasure. I'll be here adding-in my commentary as the night unfolds and look forward to seeing how the stage helps pin down the candidates' positions on major issues and/or widen their bases of support. You'll also find me in our subreddit [Discord](https://discord.gg/fHNFKuB) as always if you'd like to come yell at me in real time! Cheers, and let the fun begin!

Upon start of the debate the suggested sort in this thread will be flipped to 'new' to facilitate discussion.

In the meantime what are everyone's thoughts on the debate from the outset? What are we expecting from these candidates and the moderation?

Theres no but. The fact that Trump has a but is INCREDIBLY alarming.
Itâ€™s an extreme sign of disrespect that should never, ever happen but the final debates **MUST** give the moderators the power to cut the mics.
