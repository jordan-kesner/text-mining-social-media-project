Something I always use as an illustration when training content creators is the example of art museums. 

I love art. So much that my wife and I plan our vacations around the locations of art museums. But I follow few art museums on social media. Why? Because paradoxically, they post little content of actual art. 

I've lost count of the number of pages I've unfollowed because I was sick of seeing photos from employee wine-tasting events, or event flyers and graphics, etc. I want to follow art museums on social ... because I want to see the art!

This concept is analogous to just about every industry. What do you do? That's what people want to see. They don't want to see pictures of employees or employee events. Show them what you make/do.
