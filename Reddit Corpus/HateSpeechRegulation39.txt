Title: India makes 'liking' blasphemous content illegal:material that could offend someone's religious beliefs is prosecuted as hate speech, and that includes uploading, forwarding, sharing, liking and retweeting something:liking a post could land you in jail for 90 days before you get to see a magistrate

totally misleading headline. it is just a notice of a district police department of one of the Indian states. even the law in discussion doesnt state anything like that. some overzealous police officer has messed up this.
I'm going to start the "Holy order of cute cats are spawn of Satan and must not be seen" religion. The internet is going to be in so much trouble once I've finished being offended.
I hate these kind of titles. One small state in India passed a  law and the click bait title makes it seem like its a widespread practice in the country. Its like saying the United States passed a law that encourages racial profiling for illegal aliens (based on Arizona's SB 1070) or that the United States legalized marijuana (based on Colorado).

This law will likely not pass an Indian Supreme Court review - people have tried passing blasphemy laws before and failed.
I want to make communication with more than four people at a time (broadcasting) illegal. No exceptions.
