Title: Content Moderation - What's Your Experience?

Post:
Does anyone here work in content moderation or used to work in content moderation? I'm doing a piece about it and would love to chat with anyone who has interesting stories to tell about working in this space. Could be funny, weird, horrifying etc. I used to work in CM for a large social media company years ago so I know what it is like. If anyone's willing to chat about their experiences let me know! Feel free to respond or message me directly.
