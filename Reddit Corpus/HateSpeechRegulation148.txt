Title: Social Media is a double-edged sword.

Post:
I work in social media management and i absolutely hate my job. seeing what goes on in today's society absolutely sickens me and the majority of the harm stems from social media. division, division, division. young people are even more depressed, narcissistic behavior is on a rapid growth, and the cluttering of impressionable minds is only getting worse. yes, social media has allow lots of amazingly positive things to happen there is no denying that, but the number of positives is quickly overshadowed by the number of negatives. why is it collectively ok for companies to use people as their products? why are algorithms designed to capture as much attention from the user not being used in more productive and beneficial ways in our society? WHY IS WEALTH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE PEOPLE WHO ALLOW YOU TO BE WEALTHY?! i am tired of seeing people bicker and in worse cases DIE over such futile arguments over social media and i am tired of the division in this world. we either need to push for a social media rework, or the total dismantling of it because if we continue down this path as a society, i fear all-out chaos. neo-renaissance, neo-socialization, anti-division.

Finally! Someone other than me is saying it! (Anti) Social Media is TOXIC! It started out as a good idea, but people being people, always find a way to exploit and destroy.
Social media turns intelligent adults into self-centered juveniles.
Social media is merely the environment these activities take place in.

Division, manipulation, and hate speech all existed before social media, so it's not us inherently at fault.

You can, however, help make a better future *through social media*

Remember, all this hate comes from *ignorance*.

And ignorance is defeated by education.

Use social media to teach and make the world better, not destroy it. You'll feel better with yourself.
The biggest problem is diffusion of awareness. These platforms regularly suppress contradictory opinions to their profit, which keeps the attitude that "something is wrong" at bay... The constant division over popular news is used to keep us distracted from the fact that these companies are profiting while society suffers from the effects that social narcissism creates...

The real underlying truth is that very few people are earning serious wealth from these platforms... Even wealth as it's portrayed online is mostly exaggeration to make things look bigger than they are... Creators and influencers hold up the lies about fake success because they would be embarrassed at the truth of what they are really earning... This is why Crypto and NFTs scammed so many out of their life savings as well.

I hope that people wake up and stop posting their content to these platforms in protest... Literally millions of people work full time jobs on content creation without making a dime, while social platforms profit instantly and constantly off of all that free work and the hope and dreams of others. Social Media one of the biggest pyramid scams ever perpetrated on society, I hope it gets properly exposed and held accountable.
I completely agree with this frustration. I'm a social media manager as a side gig and it feels so silly when I stress about what the brewery I work for is gonna post on Tuesday morning about their beer when there's actual problems needing to be solved in the world.

It's easy to get consumed by the state of the world and feel a sense of obligation to fix it all ourselves. **You know as much as we all do there's only so much that one person can do.**

I'd say keep growing your skills as a social media COMMUNICATOR but find a problem you could spend time bringing attention to❗️

For me, I want to learn the skills of marketing not to feed art to consumerism, but to bring peoples attention to the things that matter. Like **environmental issues** for instance. That's a problem I want to be apart of solving in some way. Will I single handily fix the environment by making eye catching posts for a conservation company? Probably not. But I'd feel a lot better knowing my skills are being useful toward solutions of issues that I care most about.
I am an influencer with 3.2 million followers and I completely agree. I’m 55 years old and the number of hate comments that come with my good videos (THE ONES THAT DO WELL IN NUMBERS) is alarming. If I had known this would happen three years ago (I’m a new influencer as of three years ago) awhen I decided to start this job, I would have never ventured into it. 

My initial inspiration was to make a positive impact on the platform, which I did for many people.  However, the hurtful, inappropriate lies and statements spewed, mostly people under 35, about me is alarming. The social media platforms do not protect the content creators EVER. BUT THEY SHOULD. It is bizarre what feeds the social media network industry. Ten years ago I would have never imagined social media like it is now. 

I have thought about quitting many times due to the mental health impact and not feeling protected by the platforms which generate advertising revenue by allowing people like me to be abused verbally as well as mentally by strangers online. 
According to my analytics my largest audience is under 24 years old, narcissistic, liars, abusive youngsters. 

There are MANY good people. The negative aspect has started to sway greatly to outweigh the positive in the last two years.
I study mediascience, not because I like media but because I hate media with a passion.  I know where you're coming from. 

There's a lot of research going into both your problems with social media, and I'm doing s side piece on the "media economic vortex" as Marx describes the capitalist vortex. Its basically what media does to catch our attention, and I have thought about making my professor recommend me a paper on the attention war going on. 
The second thing is the problem of framing, priming and inciting bias. I can recommend Erving Goffmans essay on framing as I'm currently reading that. These things can tell us how media is used to instil thoughts onto the reader, I read the quote "...While media is professient in telling us what to think abou, its also highly capable of telling us what to think". How newssites frame their news, media properties and now the high datacollecting of the prosumer, has clearly made a strong political divide, if not a divide of the social reality, as described by Couldry in "The mediated construction of reality"
Read up on Marshall McLuhan. The medium is always more important than the message, because mediums change how we see and interact in our reality. "Understanding Media" should be required reading.
