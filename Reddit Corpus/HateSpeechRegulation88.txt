Title: It's time to build & nurture a social media community

Post:
The words social media have become synonymous with community in this day and age. Now this gathering of people who follow you could be as close as the next door or as far away as another continent altogether. In this community, you can discuss issues of the highest importance to them, share humorous anecdotes with the ones that deserve the most, or promote what you all believe in. The world has become increasingly digital and community-oriented and so every brand must engage in various social media practices. As a business, it can be hard to get started with social media but the rewards are much greater.

Before you create the social media community it is crucial to make sure that you have clearly defined the objectives of your brand. It could be anything — adding service sign-ups, enhancing product awareness or creating authentic content generated by the users. The goals will depend on the tactics that you employ and the platforms where you choose to create the community. It is also crucial to make sure that these are in alignment with the overall aims of your business. When your brand has a clear identity you connect the best with your audience. However, for this, the identity must also resonate with values that your audience can empathize with!

One of the most effective marketing strategies for social media community building is to select the right channels. As part of your decision, you must think of the preferences and demographics of the target audience along with the overall marketing goals, existing kinds of content on your website, resources available to you, and insights from the social media usage of your competitors. Various platforms cater to different types of content and demographics. For example, Instagram is popular among younger audiences and visually driven while LinkedIn is ideal for B2B (business-to-business marketing) and professional networking. The beauty of platforms such as YouTube is that they offer you the chance for rapid growth and let you put up video content relevant to your business.

Engagement is a logical pivotal step that follows clarification of brand goals and choice of social media platforms for community building. When you are communicating effectively within your social media community it helps you solidify them as sanctuaries for people who are genuinely enthusiastic about your brand. Rather than just using incentives or promotions to start your community you can take hints from the pulse of your community. Listen to what they are discussing, asking, and interacting about. Successful brands always encourage engagement and trust.

Once you have got your social media community up and running it is important for you to be proactive in nurturing it as well. This will make sure that the community is vibrant and relevant. Remember that effective community management never stops — you have to keep on doing it. You can also appoint dedicated moderators to monitor the activities in the community and foster engagement over there. You also need to follow certain steps when you are trying to improve interaction within the community such as beginning discussions on relevant subjects.

If you want to make the social media community grow and succeed it is important that you collaborate. For this, you can bring together your social media marketers and community management team to create a unified experience and message. The social media marketing team can pay attention to metrics like engagement rates and follower count. On the other hand, your community management team can focus on the likes of membership growth, user-generated content, and event sign-ups. However, both will focus on one common area — the number of social media followers converting to becoming community members.

If you activate experts and thought leaders it can and will elevate the appeal and exclusivity of your community. These people would provide you with original insights that will enrich the community. You can always repurpose such insights for platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn and gain more followers in the process.

If you wish to draw more people to your social media community you have to find out your brand advocates and engage more with them. They are individuals who follow, appreciate, and share your brand’s content ardently. You can offer them exclusive perks like opportunities for beta testing or access to VIP (very important person) events so you can forge deeper connections between your brand and them. You can also promote user-generated content, spotlight loyal customers on your social media platforms, and host community events. All these will help create a sense of appreciation and belonging among your passionate followers.

If you want a thriving social media community you have no other option but to build strong connections as they are the linchpins in this case. So many brands that used to dominate the social media landscape at one point in time fell off the radar because they did not have strong connections with their users. So, if you want to make sure that your community is flourishing you should create strong relationships with your audience and become indispensable to them. For this, in the initial stages of your community, you can adopt proactive engagement strategies.

Apart from these, you must automate your social media strategy to build a strong community in the virtual world. If you want to make sure that your social media community is thriving and engaged you have to be consistent and automated posts on such platforms can be so helpful for you in this particular regard. This way, you can maintain a steady presence even as you offer fresh updates and content to your audience without fail. Not only does this keep your community engaged but it also makes sure that you are using your time on social media optimally as a brand.
