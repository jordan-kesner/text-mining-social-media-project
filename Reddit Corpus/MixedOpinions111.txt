Title: State of the Sub: Happy New Year!

Post:
Happy New Year, everyone! We hope that you enjoyed the week away from /r/ModeratePolitics and the grind of political discourse. The Mod Team certainly did. It wasn't all fun and games for us though. We've been hard at work putting together several changes that we feel reflect the desires of the community and the goals of /r/ModeratePolitics. With that said, let's jump right into it.

###Weekly General Discussion Threads

You may notice that there is currently a second stickied post in this community. Based on the feedback in our [December State of the Sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/r83n0l/state_of_the_sub_december_edition/), we will be hosting weekly General Discussion threads through the month of January. Feel free to use these threads for any discussion you wish. It need not be political in nature. We hope this will help serve to bridge the political divide and let you meet some of our regular posters in a more casual setting.

The posts will go live every Friday and be stickied through Sunday evening (or whenever a Mod gets around to removing it). In February, we'll be looking to gather feedback from the community, and from that decide whether to make these threads a regular thing. 

###Updates to Law 1

Law 1 bears a lot of the load when it comes to our Laws of Conduct. The wording of Law 1 can also be fairly confusing to those not familiar with it. Based on community feedback, we have re-written Law 1 to hopefully eliminate some of this confusion. Law 1 now reads:

> Law 1. Civil Discourse
> Do not engage in personal attacks or insults against **any** person or group. Comment on content, policies, and actions. 
> Do not accuse fellow redditors of being intentionally misleading or disingenuous; assume good faith at all times.

For those of you who regularly participate in this community, rest assured that the change in wording does not constitute a change in enforcement.

###Updates to Law 2

Previously, Link Posts to a primary source were exempt from the starter comment requirement (although a starter comment was certainly encouraged). In practice, people were ignoring this exemption and posting a starter comment anyways. To continue to simplify the rules and maintain consistency, we're removing this exemption. Starter comments are now required for *all* Link Posts. For the 3 of you this change will affect, we apologize.

###Annual Demographics Survey Ideas
Many of you may remember the [Subreddit Demographics Survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/oeaf15/2021_rmoderatepolitics_subreddit_demographics/) we conducted back in June of 2021. With the new year, we'd like to begin gathering feedback from the community on what to include in *this* year's survey. What questions should we add or remove? Was the survey too long? Should we focus more on demographics, or should we continue to dive into policy? Give us your feedback, and we'll see what we can incorporate this year.

###We're Not Omnipotent. Report Violations. 
If you see a violation of either Reddit ToS or the community rules, report it. We operate almost exclusively via the Mod Queue. If you don't report a violation, don't expect us to act on it.

###Transparency Report
Since our last State of the Sub, there have been 3 actions performed by Anti-Evil Operations. Several members of this community have also claimed that when they report a comment for "Breaks Subreddit Rules", it will occasionally be re-classified as "Harassment" upon submission (which sends the report to the Admins). The Admins are looking into this.

###Final Thoughts
While on break, we had well over 100 of you reach out to the Mod Team asking why the subreddit was private. So consider this your advanced notice that we'll be doing this again next year.

Top Comments:
This comment has been removed in protest of reddit's decision to kill third-party applications, and to prevent use of this comment for AI training purposes.

I believe this is a site-wide issue, I've had this happen as well, at least on other subs. Even though the it's kind of useless. I've reported slurs before (not on this sub) and Reddit's like "lol no harassment here".

I wasn't here for that but, just judging by it...

All questions seem to be fine. I'm surprised to see so many lurkers! Though as I read through the suggestions:

> Might be kind of silly and never used, but a rule against "excessive" **sweating** might improve civility. I've definitely seen some text posts and comments with too much unnecessary emotional outrage

So have the mods improved the air conditioning here or is it still like 90 degrees?
I would greatly appreciate it if the mods enforced the rules against a certain user who is in every thread insulting Democrats, and wishing others don't get to vote.
u/Statman12 had a fairly striking comment that was removed by the mods. It really does show the uneven enforcement of rules on this sub. I think his edit went a bit far with the language (he should not have included trolls), though the discussion he included was fairly spot on.

It is not something I have ever done, though I have considered doing it. You know, like copying one of agentpanda's extreme posts like the detailed metaphorical description of democratic party raping America, and seeing whether it would lead to a ban for me, whereas for panda it is just seen as some harmless fun.

Some people see the falling participation in the sub of liberals/left wing/democrats as a reaction to the political environment, but it has always seemed to be more about the subs environment to me. When rules are enforced differently for liberal/left/democrat than for the right/libertarian/trumpy people, it really pushes people away.
Can I get a explanation I saw it as an old rule but don't know if it's a thing still. 

Why is saying Hitler is a racist a banned statement?

Is it the same for Kamala is a communist?

Idk I just saw a server talking about the rule and it seemed wierd to me that that's is considered a no go?
I am a left leaning moderate but I do appreciate this sub more than other political ones. Why? Because I want to discuss politics and hear from both sides. I donâ€™t want to hive mind and hear stuff from ONLY the left or ONLY the right. Thank you for all you do!
Welcome back!

You have been missed. 

Despite some of the negative comments, this is a well moderated sub that provides a much needed counter balance to the leftist tilt common in most other online forums. 

The silent majority appreciates what you do.
