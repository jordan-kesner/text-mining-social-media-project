Title: Looking for a social media manager/ video editor for our informative social media app (infotik)

Post:


Hey guys,

We are a bunch of uni students who got tired of the brain rot content of social media and so we decided to create a new app where you can scroll while getting smarter.

Its basically like Instagram reels or TikTok but all videos are fact-checked and linked to external souced for verification.

We are looking for a social media manager or video editor who can help us grow our presence organically on Instagram tiktok Reddit and other socials.

we are just starting off so it could definitely be a long-term oppertnity

If you like the ide and are interested do reply.

Cheeeers!!
