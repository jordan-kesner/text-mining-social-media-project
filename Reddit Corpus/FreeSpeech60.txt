Title: Fauci emails reveal big tech censorship was directed by government

Post:
Complaints about Big Tech censorship of discussion surrounding the COVID-19 issue was often met with the rebuttal that private companies can do what they want, and only government can violate the First Amendment, including on this sub. 

We now have evidence of collusion between Big Tech and the government to censor and direct the conversation on the platforms.

It's also coming out that in private the government knew the very things it was colluding with Big Tech to censor.

Is this a valid loophole in the first amendment? Zuckerberg and Fauci literally emailing each other to conspire to censor your speech? Is it legitimate for corporations to get a free pass on censorship if they are working in cahoots with the government on the allowed messaging?

One of the censored topics is the lab leak hypothesis. Fauci is now admitting that it is possible, as he knew and indicated in his emails that were hidden from the public until now. The emails indicate that he worked with Big Tech to censor discussion about this. It was not simply businesses acting independently, they were in collusion with government.

The whole government/big tech/corporations need to be shut down and re-evaluate but it will never happen. Fauci delt with china using US money. Why are we forgetting the crack/foot jobs in China? I'm all for capitalism but unfortunately the gaps gone to far between me and the highest paid employee by the government 'Fauci' lol how does he make more than the president.
This person highlights some of the damning emails. The "source" is the emails themselves, the reporter is not the source.

In this sub we should be focusing on the Free Speech implications, specifically of corporations colluding with government to shut down Free Speech. We should not be arguing about the existence of the emails.
If they are being pushed by the government? Yes. Private corporations can still censor speech. 

Every government official even remotely involved needs to be released from office and have their pensions stripped and be tried for treason
I miss when Facebook made the announcement they would honour free speech and not let any government body influence their platform. Then the next day they bow to Muslims.
To be clear, this tactic of pretending to be ignorant or perhaps keeping ones self intentionally ignorant and demanding that someone spoon feed evidence of something that is in the public record is exactly that, a tactic. The person employing it is attempting to use low-effort discrediting to imply that the claim is false, without actually making an argument or offering any counter points.  


Unsurprisingly, the first link in a DDG search for "Fauci Zuckerberg" is this:
