I remember that time when people genuinely thought he was going to get the death sentence for what he was posting and he didn't. Disappointing.
Malaysia is Muslim country. They are probably more concerned with limiting access to "unislamic" content, like nudity or implied nudity.

They also explicitly list "internet messaging services" as requiring a license, so I could see the country quickly getting blocked by everyone if they try to manage encryption backdoors or other bullshit.
YouTube ain’t really social media though. You don’t have friends and for the most part it’s viewer <> Creator (similar to Netflix but with slightly more interactivity IMO).
