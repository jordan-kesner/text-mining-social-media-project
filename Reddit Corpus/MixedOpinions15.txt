Title: CMV: Democrats are not liberal anymore.

Post:
**Edit:** I reworded the first paragraph of the post to better capture my position.

&#x200B;

Growing up, I was a strong liberal. I'm still a strong liberal. Climate change, income inequality, campaign finance, internet neutrality, gay marriage, name a liberal position I probably agree with it. I thought religious people were dumb as bricks. I was all onboard the Hitchens, Dawkins, Colbert train. Religion, for the most part, was antiquated, irrational, and illiberal in content and belief. Gays should have rights? Duh. Not even a debate to me. I am NOT a republican now, not in the slightest. But, I think there is a creepy PC cancel culture undercurrent in the democratic party that I detest.

The culture wars:

I don't really care if someone is trans, gay, etc. I just don't care. I advocate for their rights and their freedom to be who they want to be. But then the idea of microaggressions, the idea that everything is racist, and this obsession with diversity and inclusivity of everything to the point where if you're not a minority you are basically part of the problem. The idea that anyone who has any criticism on these issues, just should not be allowed to speak. Should not have a platform. Absurd in my view. The ACLU famously defended neo nazis right to parade around the streets because freedom of speech is absolute.  [https://www.aclu.org/other/aclu-history-taking-stand-free-speech-skokie](https://www.aclu.org/other/aclu-history-taking-stand-free-speech-skokie) because the entire point of freedom of speech is anyone can say whatever the fuck they want to say. Imagine the ACLU doing that now. Why would democrats be upset that Disney is losing special protections in Florida? They are part of the problem! They're as dystopian as any other mega corporation. Why would democrats be against musk buying out twitter IF his intention is purely to just allow free speech?

I'll admit though, a part from the issue with free speech, which I have a very firm grasp that the democrats are wrong, it's difficult for me to put a finger on what exactly went wrong and where. It almost seems like a cultural thing. Here I thought the reason most people hated democrats was because they were smug, coastal elitists who questions the system, burned flags, and defended the liberties of degenerates because that's what freedom is. And I was all for that! Now, most people I feel like hate democrats because they think everything is racist, non-group think is bad, Islam is a religion of peace, and safe spaces are good. And I am not for any of that. I feel as though the democratic party has been hijacked by leftists and is no longer actually liberal.

**Edit 2:**

I've been convinced that this is a minority issue in the democratic party, not the majority.

I'm also much more against the "don't say gay bill" than I originally was, I was always against, but didn't see it as a big deal. It is a big deal.

**Edit 3: The safe space**

Van Jones.... Van Jones. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zms3EqGbFOk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zms3EqGbFOk)

If van jones is a fake liberal tucker carlson right wing mouth piece...o boy

> everything is racist, non-group think is bad, Islam is a religion of peace, and safe spaces are good. And I am not for any of that. I feel as though the democratic party has been hijacked by leftists and is no longer actually liberal.

A lot of leftist ideas are explicitly anti-liberal, leftists generally don't like liberals. Things like critical theory are in part critiques of liberalism. But I don't think it's fair to say the mainstream democratic party is no longer liberal just because there are some more radical people in the party who believe these things, and these ideas being anti-liberal doesn't mean every idea that is distantly related to them is anti-liberal. The democratic party is not made up mainly of leftists either. 

> they think everything is racist, non-group think is bad, Islam is a religion of peace, and safe spaces are good. 

These ideas aren't necessarily "anti-liberal". "everything is racist" can mean anything from "we all probably have some internal racist bias" (which seems fairly reasonable) to "all structures need to be overthrown because they all cause white supremacy" (definitely not as reasonable imo).  
I'm not really sure what you mean by "non group think being bad". Isn't group think just when people come to irrational unjustified conclusions because it's considered "the proper take" or whatever? Obviously this isn't good, but every group does this and I don't think it really has anything to do with liberalism.  
Islam being a religion of peace isn't really liberal or anti-liberal. Religious freedom is a liberal position, and I think people who say "Islam is peaceful" are probably more likely to support the freedom to practise Islam.  
Safe spaces doesn't just mean hug-box echo chambers, it's just places for marginalised people to feel comfortable discussing issues that affect them. As long as these ideas are still allowed to be criticised on more public platforms it's not inherently harmful. 

The idea of absolute freedom of speech is something the US likes but isn't seen as quite as important in a lot of European countries. For example in Germany it's illegal to display symbols of Nazism. I don't think it's fair to say "Germany isn't a liberal country" because of this.
>The ACLU famously defended neo nazis right to parade around the streets because freedom of speech is absolute. because the entire point of freedom of speech is anyone can say whatever the fuck they want to say. Imagine the ACLU doing that now.

The ACLU still defends free speech. Look [here](https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/defending-speech-we-hate) at the list of conservative, alt-right, and openly bigoted organizations the ACLU has been defending, 2017-present. 

>Why would democrats be upset that Disney is losing special protections in Florida? They are part of the problem! They're as dystopian as any other mega corporation. 

It's might be a problem if a corporation has special treatment. Disney's particular arrangement is more of a gray area. They pay *more* in taxes, in exchange for being able to approve their own projects. They're not any less strict about what they approve than normal government inspectors, they're just more efficient.

But over a thousand different companies in Florida have similar arrangements. It's only *one* company that is having their arrangement taken away, and only because they said something the party in power dislikes. This is an even more blatant threat to free speech than anything else. The government shouldn't be able to base how you are treated on whether you say something critical about them or not.

>Why would democrats be against musk buying out twitter IF his intention is purely to just allow free speech?

If I go to a restaurant, and someone there is loudly talking about how they hope that the Jewish people will be exterminated, the manager of the restaurant can throw them out. I'd be fine with that. If someone else says "I'm going to buy that restaurant and stop censoring that guy" it would be illiberal to *prevent* that person from buying the restaurant. But it wouldn't be Illiberal to say "I don't think I'll go there anymore if he's in charge, I rather dislike hearing Nazi propaganda while I'm relaxing." That's *my* choice.
Okay but the reason that you think that democracts aren't liberal anymore clearly isn't that you think they have become authoritarians, or marxists, or like, royalists or something - all things that would actually be described as not-liberal. What your argument here actually is just saying that well they're still liberals but they started being liberal about things that I don't like and that's bad. Like, in your post, you're not really explaining how the Democrats are no longer liberals, you've just giving examples of specific opinions that you don't like and pretending that the democrats are acting like authoritarians about those opinions. But they're not, right? There isn't a movement to make it illegal to be white or penalize people for micro-aggression. The only possible way to think that would be if you interpret criticism as censorship, which it isn't, and is actually of course an authoritarian position: People shouldn't be allowed to say mean things that might get other people de-platformed; the heckler's veto should not exist and therefore we need to curtail the free speech of the masses to prevent it. 

The other ironic thing is that you gave Neo-nazism as an example of a position that you don't like, but should still be protected. Okay, neo-nazis aren't liberals, they are explicitly genocidal authoritarians. So, we should protect the right to be a neo-nazi and demonstrate in favor of neo-nazi beliefs, but if somebody would be an authoritarian anti-racist (something you haven't actually given an example of, but whatever) - presumably that would be going too far, and an example of how the democrats have become authoritarians? The Democrats defending the beliefs of neo-nazis would be good and liberal, but the democrats defending the beliefs of Muslims, is bad and not liberal? Hmm

Moreover, this is a side note, but it is very funny to be like "why are these so-called liberals against one man buying and taking over a huge part of online discourse?" you know, I don't know. Maybe have a think about that one
>I don't really care if someone is trans, gay, etc. I just don't care. I advocate for their rights and their freedom to be who they want to be.

I have never heard a liberal or a Democrat try and push this narrative, the only time I hear this narrative is as a right wing Republican dog whistle to attack liberals or democrats. 

>Why would democrats be upset that Disney is losing special protections in Florida? They are part of the problem! They're as dystopian as any other mega corporation. Why would democrats be against musk buying out twitter IF his intention is purely to just allow free speech?

They are upset because the sole reason for this attack on Disney is because Disney stood up for LGBTQ+ people. Musk is the embodiment of republican hate he is only wanting to buy Twitter to silence the people speaking against him. Hell he was found to keep his Tesla plants segregated and has lied and been sued for the illegal acts his company's do. 

It is a little weird you praise Musk, the son of a blood Dimond mine owner who is only wealthy because of that, who has countless attacked minorities and free speech, yet you attack Disney who has tried to reinvent themselves from the shady past they have had and use their company to try and show repsentation and stand for minorities.

This is just a paragraph of dog whistles for the GOP.

The idea that anyone who has any criticism on these issues, just should not be allowed to speak. Should not have a platform. 

That's not really a belief of the Democratic party though.

>Now, most people I feel like hate democrats because they think everything is racist, non-group think is bad, Islam is a religion of peace, and safe spaces are good. And I am not for any of that. I feel as though the democratic party has been hijacked by leftists and is no longer actually liberal.

Again, not a position of the Democratic party at all.

I don't hate Muslims if that's what you mean though. Freedom of religion absolutely is a Democratic belief.
>I feel as though the democratic party has been hijacked by leftists and is no longer actually liberal.    

I find it ironic that you at the same time:   
- Complain Democrats are no longer liberal     
- Complain that the government doesn't interfere with private companies' right to free speech      

Which is it? Do you want more liberalism from Democrats or do you want more government interference with private businesses? They're pretty contradictory values you're preaching here.
Dude do you even know what a liberal is? The democratic party is pure neoliberalism not leftism. Everything you say sounds incoherent af
>  Why would democrats be upset that Disney is losing special protections in Florida? 

Because the move was clearly in retaliation for opposing the "Don't Say Gay" bill in Florida. Giving and taking away legal protections based on spite is not a good way to run a government or to keep things fair. 

>  Why would democrats be upset that Disney is losing special protections in Florida? 

Because Democrats recognise that unmitigated free speech is a dangerous tool and one of the main ways that misinformation and disinformation spread was through people like Donald Trump's Twitter account which actively undermined trust in elections, in government, and in helping to reduce the impact of the pandemic. 

Free Speech is as Free Speech does but private companies *also* have free speech and forcing them to abide by government rules sets a dangerous agenda in politics where private companies are defacto government bodies. 

>  The ACLU famously defended neo nazis right to parade around the streets because freedom of speech is absolute.

The ACLU has never said the freedom of speech right is absolute, either. They have defended people who have had their rights violated but they also recognise that freedom of speech has limitations and there are cases where it's not cut and dry. 

> But then the idea of microaggressions,

Definition: commonplace daily verbal, behavioral or environmental slights, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative attitudes toward stigmatized or culturally marginalized groups 

Examples: Asking people where they *really* come from (no, really, where did your *parents* come from), telling a black woman her hair is 'unprofessional' when she wears it naturally, asking an Asian student to pick an 'easier name' for you to say, telling someone who you think looks Asian "Ni Hao!" before you even know them. 

> the idea that everything is racist

We've had police kneeling on black men's necks and the president defended them. I don't want to say everything is racist but *there's a lot of racist problems in this country* and the only way to fix it is to point it out and keep telling people it's bad and it needs to change. If that makes you uncomfortable, then you should ask why someone saying something is racist makes you more uncomfortable *than the racist thing in the room.* 

> and this obsession with diversity and inclusivity 

Flordia passed a law that says "don't say gay", companies are still fighting for the right to ban people from being trans and out at work, America's upper management is still predominantly male and white, and there is still no paid parental leave federally mandated across the country. Maternal mortality is still overwhelmingly higher for women of colour, especially black women. There are massive regions of the country with swathes of poverty with underserved communities that rely on government handouts, many of whom have become this way due to manufacturing being outsourced and the surrounding towns losing their main source of income. Native women are still being murdered and their killers never found. Environmental justice is still woefully inadequate and America's rivers and lakes are being posioned by agricultural run off, pollution, and water theft, which disproportionately affects poor communities like Flint Michigan. 

Is it a bad thing to keep pointing out that America sucks at diversity and inclusivity when it's so clearly demonstrated again and again and again  at every level of government, education, and society?
