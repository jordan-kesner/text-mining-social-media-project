The more Meta products are taken for, the worse the quality of Instagram and Facebook becomes. I am absolutely convinced that such monopolistic manifestations in general negatively affect the development of the sphere and, apparently, only worsen the user experience.  
  
I highly doubt that the Twitter equivalent will be a successful product, because instead of trying to adapt a concept already known to everyone, you need to focus on creating something unique.
It will be hampered by Meta's urge to tie it into all their other products. I don't have high expectations.
