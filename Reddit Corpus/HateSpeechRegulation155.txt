Title: Stuck on social media

Post:
Hi! I've been working in social media marketing for a couple of years now and I've come to the conclusion that it just isn't for me. I've tried different roles on different parts of social media. 

I've tried being a social media manager, community manager, engagement coordinator, and now I work as a Creative at a digital agency coming up with social media ideas and strategies for other clients. 

Honestly, I'm so tired of doing this and every job I've had I've hated and ended up not staying longer than two years. I would really love to pursue something that more focused on just writing and using my researching skills. I'm sick of writing decks and briefs and doing presentations all the time and I just don't find working in social media as fulfilling for me.

I've been interested in going into journalism or something similar? Just wondering if anyone has managed to make the jump to a different field? 

I feel like I've tried to look in other fields but I only seem employable for social media roles ðŸ˜”
