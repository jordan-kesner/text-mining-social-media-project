Title: Up/down vote mechanic concept

Post:
I think the up vote and down vote system is a little flawed for a lot of reasons, but one of them is it assumes everyone’s vote should be equal, which I don’t agree with and I’ll explain.

I think how often you down/up vote should dictate the strength and influence of your down and up vote. If your a down vote bully, who down votes a lot, it will count less than someone who only occasionally down votes because when they do you know it’s more serious.

Similar to up votes as well. If you up vote almost everything, likely your more easily content or just want to help people with the algorithm, while someone who very rarely up votes, their’s should count for more because it has more meaning giving that person usually reserves their up vote for the very best.

everyone's vote should be equal because the moment you try to weight them based on assumptions you're making, as you are doing by assuming someone who upvotes "almost everything" is "easily content or just want to help people" when perhaps those people are only viewing content they sought out or are in a community they, by the focus of it, they agree with the majority of the content with.

Take some stats and analytics and psych courses, and perhaps some poli-sci, and get back to me about devaluing people's votes. ;)
