Title: CMV: A person should not be able to be charged with a DUI or DWI unless you are actually driving.

Post:

When I was in college a roommate went out drinking one night, got in an arguement with someone in the bar, and decided to leave.  He realized that he had had too much to drink, so he called a ride.  It was mid August and super hot outside, so while he was waiting on his ride he sat in in his truck and ran the A/C.  A police officer saw him and took him in for a DWI and he was convicted.  It effected his employment and schooling for the next couple of years.

I never liked the guy much, but I always thought he got a raw deal. He was doing the right thing and got the same penalty as if he decided to drive home.  You should be able to sleep it off in your car without fear of consequence.

I have heard the argument that if the officer saw a drunk sitting in their car and just walked away from it, the person could start driving at any moment.  I argue that it would be just as easy to take the person home as it would be to take them to jail, and it doesnt ruin their life. The police could even take them to the jail to dry out for the night just to be sure, but there is no reason to suspend their license, fine, and imprison a person for simply sitting in their car with the keys in their possession, or even sitting in a running vehicle. 

To head off the first argument I see coming, this doesn't apply to a vehicle in a lane of traffic, obviously if you are passed out at a stop sign or something you deserve a DWI.

Update: After reading tons of comments my view has been changed marginally to believe that what he did should not be completely legal.  I believe that there should be some form of moderate traffic citation with a fine associated with it along with a ride home or a night in the drunk tank.  That way the police can prevent tragedies while not making the assumption that the person was definitely going to drive and ruining the person's life.

Dont expect any more replies from me, I have the day off with my family and I'm not spending any more time on my phone. Feel free to discuss amongst yourselves.

Thank you for understanding.
The DUI laws vary from state to state, but in CA there can be an argument that being in a parked car while drunk does not constitute a DUI. But being in the drivers seat, with the engine running, makes it very difficult to give the jury a reasonable doubt that you are not a “driver” as defined in the state vehicle code.
I think he would have a stronger case if he had been in the passenger seat or in the backseat 

Not quite the same thing, but I feel like it's a little bit like if someone had had 10 candy bars in their jeans pockets in a convenience store.  Like, maybe they *could* be using their pockets to carry their purchases instead of a grocery basket. I think technically it is only shoplifting after you leave with the items,... But having something hidden in your pants in the store isn't on the up and up either.
It sounds like they had a horrible defense attorney. It should have been reduced to a lesser charge if he never drove and was able to show that he called a ride who was en route. Not sure what part of the world this was in, but your friend may be able to get it expunged over time as long as they don’t commit any other “crimes”. I get that the arresting officer was just following procedures, but they could have confirmed he had a ride and had him turn his keys in to the bar or taken them to the station for him to get the next day… something other than an arrest and prosecution. I feel like there is a little more to the story.
Was he in the driver seat?  Perhaps in these circumstances in order to show you are not intending to drive you sit in the passenger seat or a back seat.  Otherwise I can totally understand law enforcement erring on the side of caution.

Better a ticket to someone who "may" have been intending to drive, than allowing drunk people, you know, people who may not be thinking correctly suddenly deciding they are now well enough to drive.
I think the reason they arrest for that is because some people try to be sneaky and just pull over and pretend they weren't drining if there is a cop around. Here is a great example of someone who claimed they were just 'waiting for a mate' when clearly they have been driving.

It isn't always that obvious though.

I have heard in the past that you'd be allowed to get into the back of your car as long as you don't have keys in the ignition and you aren't in the driver's seat, but not sure what the exact law is and how much it would vary by state and country.
First, it sucks your friend got screwed like that, I’m sorry.

In my opinion here, the main problem is really that the law is poorly communicated. People hear “don’t drink and drive!” but the law is actually “don’t be drunk with your engine on.”

You said in another comment that “people shouldn’t be able to accidentally commit a crime”, and although that’s obviously difficult to achieve, I agree with the spirit of it. If “don’t be drunk with your engine on” was widely known, you probably wouldn’t be making this post, because then your friend would have just been brazenly breaking a law everyone knows about, instead of getting picked up on a technicality.

I do also agree that moving and not moving should be treated differently, as well as other circumstances (eg “I can prove I called a ride”, “I’m in a parking lot”)

But as other people have pointed out, there are many perfectly acceptable “pre-hurting-people”-crimes - for example, I can’t walk around LA with a rocket launcher, and no one would be surprised if I was charged for that, and no one would say “he wasn’t going to hurt anyone with it!” - it doesn’t matter, rocket launchers are banned and everyone knows that. I can’t even own one at home.

Obviously owning a rocket launcher and sitting in the driver’s seat of a running car while drunk aren’t the same thing, but they’re both “harmless” patterns of behaviour which government/society has decided to prevent, for the greater good.

So my question is: would you still completely oppose a law against sitting in the driving seat with the engine turned on while drunk, if “don’t even turn on a car while drunk” (or something like that) was widely and very well understood?
Reading through this thread I can see why sitting in drivers seat with car running should have some level of criminality. It's poor judgement and puts people at risk, because a drunk person behind the wheel of a running parked car can become a drunk person behind the wheel of a running moving car very quickly and easily.

However, I also am of the opinion that the law should be changed to allow for a spectrum. Perhaps this is achieved in practice on a case by case basis by lowering the charge to a lesser one like reckless driving, but I would prefer that be encapsulated into the law itself. For example, operating while intoxicated could be a lower charge than operating and driving while intoxicated. Operating alone might result in a fine but not suspended license and permanent record, or something along those lines.

That leaves some work to do by cops or judge to determine which law fits a given case. Guy sitting in parking lot beside bar, whose friend shows up 15 minutes later to give him a ride home? Pretty obvious. Guy sitting on side of highway with front end of car smashed into a tree? Also pretty obvious. There will be some cases that are less clear. If the cop isn't sure which charge is correct, that's what courts are for.
I have a similar story.   Campus police at the University of Conn. 

A few of us went to visit our friend for the weekend.  This is the mid 90's.  We were staying in his dorm and some ahole pulled the fire alarm at 3am.

We were all drunk and sleeping when it happened.  Went outside to wait but it was freezing out.  Literally.  We were all in t shirts and my friend remembered that heleft his keys under his floor mat so we went to his car to run the heat and warm up.

The cop must have been watching us because as soon as he started the car we had a knock on the drivers window.  "Have you been drinking?"  "Yes, but we're not going anywhere, just staying warm until we can go back into the dorm."


"Step out of the car please."

He was arrested and charged with OUI.
I got a dui for sleeping in my truck after a party out near this park. I was parked at the park so I walked back and passed out in my truck. Even threw the keys in my box because I thought no keys on me no way would I have issues. Nope cop wakes me up by tapping on the window, it’s an older truck so I roll down the windows manually and he proceeds to arrest me upon realizing I’ve had a few beers and he can smell it. Spent the night in jail and the next 13 months and 9 court dates fighting it paying like 8,000$ in lawyer fees. Finally won and have hated the legal system ever since. 

Fuck this system so much this no injured party but someone still gets charged bullshit gets old real quick.
