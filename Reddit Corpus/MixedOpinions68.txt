Title: CMV: The Jedi are full of shit and leaning toward the "Dark" Side is the way to go.

Post:
I was looking at the Sith and Jedi codes, and it made me realize how full of shit the Jedi are. The Jedi seem to encourage a lack of emotion and strict internal discipline.


Just look at their respective codes.


The Jedi Code:

There is no emotion, there is peace.

There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.

There is no passion, there is serenity.

There is no chaos, there is harmony.

There is no death, there is the Force.


The Sith Code:

Peace is a lie, there is only passion.

Through passion, I gain strength.

Through strength, I gain power.

Through power, I gain victory.

Through victory, my chains are broken.

The Force shall free me.


Now, while certain parts of the Jedi Code, specifically lines 2 and 5, are good, the rest of it seems to be pushing a worldview based on restraint, discipline, and order. Now this in and of itself is fine, but it accomplishes this by restricting the influence of passion. Passion & emotion is the chief governing factor in Humans. Maybe it's different for certain alien species, I don't know.


The Sith, on the other hand, encourage passion. They use it, control it, and gain strength and inspiration from it. This is their strength, but also their weakness. Emotion can grant power, but it can also blind you.


So neither the cold, orderly philosophy of the Jedi nor the reckless abandon of restraint of the Sith are necessarily worth following. Passion should never be without restraint, but the abandonment of it by the Jedi is both unrealistic and harmful to it's members. So while I wouldn't endorse the entirety of Sith philosophy, I would certainly endorse leaning into the "Dark Side" more than the "Light".


I just wrote a 1500 character wall of text on the philosophy of space ninjas. I am a massive fucking nerd.

My time has fucking come. Get ready, OP, to be amazed by my dumb knowledge of ridiculous amounts of knowledge about Star Wars lore and my ability to quote obscure af Star Wars books. I am incredibly sorry in advance for how long this got....I got excited.

So first of all, that's not actually the original Jedi Code. The Original Code is this:

>*Emotion, yet peace.*  
>  
>*Ignorance, yet knowledge.*  
>  
>*Passion, yet serenity.*  
>  
>*Chaos, yet harmony.*  
>  
>*Death, yet the Force.*

Both versions of the Code are actively taught and used within the Jedi Order, though the one you cited is the one that gets bandied around far more prominently. The Code I just cited is taught to Jedi Younglings, who recite it during their Initiate Trials before becoming a padawan. With this code, you can see that what is actually being taught within the Order is not an absence or denial of emotion but a moderation of it. Anakin even straight up says this in AOTC:

>"Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is essential to a Jedi's life. So you might say, that we are encouraged to love."

Yes, he's using it to rather cleverly maneuver around the Jedi's rules concerning marriage and romantic attachment, but he's iterating a very explicit point: compassion is encouraged within the Order. Compassion is inherently an outpouring of empathy and emotion.

Sidenote here: romantic relationships do not inherently lead to the Dark Side, something borne out by several relationships in the EU (Luke and Mara Jade, Han and Leia, Jaina Solo and Jagged Fel, Corran Horn and Mirax Terrik, etc). *Any* close relationship has the ability to turn a Light Sider to the Dark if properly prompted. Remember, it was not Padme that was Anakin’s first step towards the Dark Side, but the loss of his mother. Luke briefly used the Dark Side when goaded by Vader that he would go after Leia, his sister. Corran Horn lost his best friend and nearly turned. Obi-Wan (however briefly) fought with anger and grief and drew on the Dark Side during his confrontation with Maul while Qui-Gon was dying. The **nature** of the relationship does not matter; the person’s outlook on the relationship and their state of mind is what’s important. Selfless and compassionate love (regardless of whether it is familial, platonic, or romantic in nature) is an entirely different animal from the self-seeking, selfish attachment that the Order warns about:

>*It seems so hard, Master to have so many beings who are important to me but not to be attached to them. I don’t understand what is meant by “no attachments”.*  
>  
>*It’s not so hard to explain*, Siri had answered finally. *To have without wanting to possess or influence. To cherish without keeping. To have without holding.*  
>  
>Ferus remembered nodding. He had thought he’d gotten it. As usual, he had wanted to please her. *I understand, Master.*  
>  
>Siri had looked at him then and smiled. *No, you don’t. It’s not something to understand. It’s something to strive for.* ***– Last of the Jedi #7***

What the Jedi are actually attempting to teach Anakin (something at which they fail because their insular and monastic nature failed to account for the different upbringing and thus needs that Anakin would have as a recently-freed slave child who grew up with his mother) is not the *denial* of emotions but *control* over them. Basically: "every human being has emotions. It's natural. Your job is to learn how to control them because you wield super powerful magic that can *hurt* people if you don't control it."

The Force isn’t just something that allows the Jedi to lift rocks or catch glimpses of the future–it’s how they connect to the entire galaxy.  It’s how they see the world around them: the people around them, the life around them.  It’s how they feel, it’s how they parse things, it’s how they *think*. It puts them in psychic connection with those around them (to varying degrees, of course)...and this is why you need to have control.  This is why getting drunk off the Force and the emotions around you is a genuine danger and could allow you to hurt yourself and others very badly.

Feelings linger, and they echo and amplify everything–Luke still feels Rey in the stone seat she sat on, thoughts and feelings imprint into the kyber crystals and become part of the blade, The Tusken village Anakin massacred is still a ghost story to the Tuskens years later and they don't go there because the emotions and hate are still tangible...this is how a Sith bleeds a kyber crystal and creates a red lightsaber (because sidenote: red lightsabers are created via deliberate corruption of a kyber crystal, not found like 'normal' colored lightsabers).

If a Jedi were to let themselves run wild and stopped asserting emotional control over themselves, it’s like getting drunk off the Force and thinking you’re still totally in control. This is how Anakin spirals in ROTS, and if you read a book like Shatterpoint (or read the new canon *Kanan* comics) you can see how it happens to Mace Windu's former Padawan Depa Billaba.

Passion and emotion are fine, but the **excess** of passion and emotion are ***dangerous as fuck*** for powerful Force users. The thing is, the Jedi are given a tremendous amount of power and legal authority.  Their connection to the Force gives them abilities that can very easily hurt others, based on their unbalanced emotions–we *see* what even just a partially trained Force-user acting out of fear can do, when Ezra Bridger, a barely in-training padawan who got his first lightsaber less than a full episode ago, [straight up summons a nest of frynocks and compels them to attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC5uFsmpWBY) because he's afraid and loses control over his emotions. Vader, a trained force user, [*knocks Ahsoka Tano*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtrLA9mX4rw) right into unconsciousness just by feeling her out! Anakin's actions in ROTS are pretty self-explanatory.

That’s a lot of power given to one person! Add in that they’re given the authority by the Senate to help people across the galaxy? People who fear them because they don’t understand them? The Jedi understand that they have to keep their shit under control (not repressed, both new and old canon are pretty explicit on the front of how several Jedi have said emotions are necessary, you just need to control them before they rule *you*) because otherwise they’re going to leave a lot of hurt people in their wake, all the more so when given the legal power they are.  If you have the authority to cut someone’s arm off with your lightsaber because the Force told you it was necessary?  You better make *damn* sure you’re not doing it out of unbalanced emotions.

(continued below in Part 2)
And yet the Jedi are the only ones that achieve immortality by becoming one with the Force upon death. Even if the Jedi code might be restrictive or even harmful as you say, it offers an immortality that Sith cannot reach even if the Force has "set them free."

The Sith might get things done for the races of the galaxy in the short term (if you can even have a virtuous Sith), but the Jedi way allows the wisdom of the strongest and purest to endure forever, available to anyone Force-sensitive that they choose to appear to.
The ability to wield power, any power, comes with a cost. This is true even of the force. You can pay now or you can pay later, but you will always pay.

The Sith front-load the power. You sign on and take the easy, simple way directly to power. Great, you have power. You use said power, and it in turn widens and deepens your connection to that power. Which makes that power stronger. But, you haven't paid for any of that power yet. In the prequels we see flashes, visions, and the dark side pushing people to do things. This is the price to pay. You either buy in to the worst bits of Sith philosophy or watch what you've worked for crumble in front of you. People who took that direct path to power generally have *reasons* to take the power now. They have a goal they need to accomplish or something (someone?) they want to protect, giving up on that thing that motivates them and allowing that driving motivation to be overturned by others simply isn't acceptable, and so the tool twists its wielder. If all you have is hammers then everything looks like a nail, if not using the hammer also means that all the previous work you've done with said hammer gets undone then of course you use the hammer on skulls as well as on nails.

When it comes to the Jedi, they're trying to pay beforehand. Their philosophy is all about putting in the work before hand and gaining the separation to tell the force "no" and really mean it. The force is the collective unconscious of all living things, it's something shared by all living things. It has a will and goals that are not your wills or goals and sometimes the only right play is to not play when the force demands it. By earning credit with the force by meditation and action it give the Jedi both power and a free hand to use that power in the proper ways. This is, however, a tortuously slow and tedious process.

In short, the Sith get a big loan of power and can do one truly amazing thing, but is then forever sacrificing others at the whims of their creditors. The Jedi work laboriously for a very, very long time and can achieve great things only by a lifetime of preparation and self sacrifice to avoid making others pay for their actions.

In truth both are wrong. The Jedi fail because they lost track of *why* they are trying to gain power, their world has fallen into a long and protracted dark age and they themselves have atrophied to uselessness. The Sith focus on breaking chains and freedom not because it's what they *have* but what they *want*. Sith seek to control the universe around them because they cannot control themselves.

As in real life, the right answer is to take small loans that make sense to achieve your ends, but to repay it promptly and keep it modest. The real answer is to understand and use our passion, but not allow your passion to override everything else in your life. 

Of course, that is much easier said than done.
In your title, you say the dark side is the way to go, but in your text, you come to the conclusion that neither is worth following.  So, which one is it?
Listen, kid. It's important to understand why the Jedi exist, and to understand what they are.

The galaxy is a big place. Children are born, sentient, of every species. The races of the galaxy are as diverse as the plants and animals of every planet, even if a few commonalities like fingers and feet have evolved. Even in basic morphology, there are many exceptions.

But there is one thing that happens almost without exception. Of all the sentient offspring born in the galaxy, some tiny fraction -- statistically barely measurable -- has the ability to harness astonishing powers.

And this should make you terrified. Unnatural speed, agility, and strength are the norm for these mutants.  They can move objects with their minds, literally *choking off your windpipe or your circulatory system*, crushing vital organs. Worse, so much worse, they can manipulate your thoughts. Read your thoughts, and even modify them so that you think  their commands are your idea.  So that *you don't even know you were manipulated*.

That, my friend, should absolutely terrify you. If it were up to me, we'd identify the little bastards at the first sign of their "becoming" and put 'em up in front of a firing squad. If we can even get to them in time.

But these telepathic monsters got their hooks into the Republic. "Protect us," they said, "and we'll turn our powers to the will of those in charge. We'll control our own, and use our highly trained adult masters to hunt down the younglings and bring them to heel."

Look, I'm not saying the Sith are any better. But with the Sith, you know what you're getting. They wear their powers as a badge of honor. You can see the scars their powers have left behind. They don't need to control minds because they'd as soon kill you as waste time with a bug like you or me. They're not silver-tongued deceivers like the Jedi. And more importantly, they fight for power among themselves, which means they're always culling their own ranks, watching for that bigger fish that's about to swallow them up. They're not *organized* like the Jedi. They don't abduct and train children.  It's a lot easier for the little guy like you or me to avoid them.

I've been kicking around the enlisted ranks long enough to know that I'm a lot safer on the bottom of the heap with a regular schedule and 3 squares a day. Border security and backwater territory work under the direct control of the regional governor isn't so bad. At least it's far from the conflict between the Jedi and the Sith.

And I swear, one day, I will find the droids I'm looking for.
IMO the mistake that the Jedi Order made in the prequels was in cutting off all attachment. By going to such great lengths to do this, they were in fact being ruled by their fear, and IMO this is what allowed Palpatine to cast his dark shadow over the galaxy and cloud their vision.

Yoda felt certain that if Luke gave in to attachment and went to save his friends in Cloud City, he would die, or fall to the dark side. But those same friends he went to rescue were able to save him from being captured, and later on it was his attachment to his father that allowed him to overcome the darkside and win the war against the sith by refusing to fight.

Through detachment, the Jedi Order had rendered violence one of the only methods available to them to control the galaxy.

So in conclusion, Dark Side still bad, Light Side still good, but fear of the dark side is a negative emotion that itself must be controlled.
So, here's my understanding of the force, it doesn't like ambivalence. You can't take half of the sith code and half of the jedi code and just get the best of both worlds. If you want to be a powerful sith you have to embody the traits of the dark side, like passion and the pursuit of power. That lets you tap deeper into the dark side and makes you stronger in it. If you want to be a powerful jedi you have to embody the traits of the light side, like harmony and restraint. That lets you tap deeper into the light side and makes you stronger in it. If you tried to take some of both, you wouldn't be able to tap into the light or the dark as much as someone who was either a sith or a jedi (or just otherwise had those traits), and just in general wouldn't be able to channel the force as much. That's why when Anakin turned he went full blown mass murderer, he needed to embrace the dark side as much as he could so he could channel it better and increase his power with it. If he didn't commit, he wouldn't have been able to tap into the dark side to try and save Padme. There may be some workarounds here and there that let a jedi sorta use parts of the dark side, but that's not really the same thing as being neither dark side or light side.

&#x200B;

Also, just think about it. The force has been around for thousands of years. If it were possible to just walk in the middle and be stronger, or otherwise better, someone presumably would have figured that out, and whatever order they established that wasn't dark or light would have been the dominant power. Someone could maybe argue the jedi code doesn't really embody all of the traits of the light side properly, and that it could be changed, but I think the argument that you should just 'lean' into one side isn't right. If all you do is lean to one side, then you won't be strong in either one.
