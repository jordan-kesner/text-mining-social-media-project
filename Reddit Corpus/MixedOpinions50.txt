Title: CMV: Trump Will Mark the Beginning of the End of the U.S. as a Global Superpower

Post:
For the past 80 years, the United States has been *the* dominant Western superpower—militarily, economically, technologically, and culturally. However, Trump's presidency, particularly his second term, has made it clear to the rest of the world that the U.S. can no longer be relied upon as a stable military ally or a self-regulating democracy with effective checks and balances.

For decades, much of the Western world has relied on the security and global leadership of the U.S., particularly through NATO. But now, many of us are waking up to the reality that this reliance is no longer viable. Regardless of the fact that a significant portion of Americans oppose Trump and everything he represents, the fact remains: the country elected him—*twice*. This suggests one of three possibilities:

1. A deliberate and conscious choice by the public to embrace Trump’s leadership.
2. The result of institutions so weakened, corrupt, or manipulated that public ignorance was effectively engineered—potentially by external forces that stand to benefit (it would certainly align with known Russian geopolitical strategy).
3. A mix of both—some voters knowingly supporting him while others were misled by systemic dysfunction.

I say this as someone from Spain, where, like many other European nations, we have neglected our own capacity for self-defense, relying instead on NATO and the security provided by an allied nation that spends more on its military than the rest of the world combined in any given year. But Trump's America has demonstrated that this reliance is no longer sustainable.

In just three weeks (!) since his second inauguration, Trump and his administration have already threatened military action in **Panama, Gaza, Greenland**, and have come dangerously close to doing the same with **Canada**—one of the closest and strongest alliances in the world. Instead of military threats, he has chosen economic coercion to undermine Canada’s sovereignty.

People are not stupid. You can call these tactics “negotiation strategies,” “distractions,” or whatever justification you want—but that doesn’t change the long-term consequences. Whether intentional or not, Trump’s actions have made it clear that NATO, Europe, and the broader Western world can no longer depend on the United States as the so-called “world police” (a sentiment that has existed since Vietnam and solidified with Iraq).

European leaders are already acknowledging this, openly discussing the need for greater military and economic independence. And while Europe has its own issues—particularly the resurgence of far-right populism—Trump’s second term offers a *real-time case study* in how democratic institutions can be undermined from within. This might, hopefully, give European governments enough time to reinforce their own institutions before a similar phenomenon takes root here.

Beyond geopolitics, Trump’s America is also self-sabotaging its academic and technological leadership. The U.S. has long attracted the brightest minds in science, technology, and research, but under Trump, those systems are being crippled. If you are a top researcher, why would you choose to work in a country where:

* Salaries might be higher, but the quality of life is worse?
* You have unrestricted access to guns but limited reproductive rights?
* Free speech is celebrated on social media but censored in academic research?

This will inevitably lead to *brain drain*, further accelerating the decline of U.S. leadership in innovation, science, and education.

Yes, in the short term, Trump’s aggressive trade policies might secure *favorable* economic deals, but they come at the cost of severely damaging U.S. alliances and international trust—possibly beyond repair. It does not matter if Trump comes out tomorrow, apologizing for everything, and saying he is sorry (lol). Why would any country *trust* the U.S. again in the next 20 years?

I don’t see a way back from this. CMV.

Something I’ve noticed in regards to world leadership, especially in recent memory with Ukraine, is that people, including politicians, have extremely short term memory. Most of Trumps bullshit in his first term was forgotten about during Bidens term, especially after Ukraine happened. More importantly, Europe themselves can’t just decide on a whim that they’ll replace America with someone else, even if they throw themselves into the arms of China as much as possible, China has no intention of helping Europe in regards to Russia


I predict the moment Trump dies or is no longer in power, the more left leaning or moderate politicians will try to recover lost ground, and given the sheer lack of alternatives aside from China, they alongside America and the EU, will likely have a far more balanced relationship going forward.

Now, this doesn’t change your view per se, as it doesn’t involve a unipolar American dominated world, but I think people need to understand how short term much of Trumps saber rattling is. Unless an actual invasion happens, most will forget and laugh off how stupid it is.
I don’t agree that the US will cease to be a superpower. Will their power and influence decline due to Trump’s chaotic style? Potentially, yes, but they will still be a top 2 or 3 superpower long after Trump. Mostly because “superpower” is just a euphemism for which countries are economically and militarily dominant.

US economic growth has far, far outpaced Europe, LATAM and most of the rest of the world, even through COVID. So their economy is fairly resilient and absolutely massive. Just the state of California alone is the 5th largest economy in the world. Far larger than Spain’s entire economy.

Militarily, the U.S. still dominant, though very wasteful and increasingly abandoning alliances as a way to roll back global involvement. Russia, long thought to be the world’s #2 military, has turned out to be a flop, and not nearly as powerful as assumed. The only other rival even remotely close to catching the U.S. militarily is China - and they’ve never fought a single war, so we don’t really know.

I do think Trump wants to be less influential, less involved in globalism and to spend less money helping other countries, he’s made that very clear. 

But I actually think this will damage Europe the most, given their reliance on US technologies and defense spending. Europe may fall behind economically and militarily at a rapid rate if their current pace of economic growth continues.

China stands to be the biggest beneficiary, as their competition in technology, weapons and economics will shrink to essentially just the United States and maybe India in some areas.
1. 
The U.S is still a constitutional democracy. It is not a "Dictatorship" like how half of reddit would like you to believe. Even during Trump's First term courts, state, and the military upheld the democratic norm. Even if he were to push policies and executive orders too extreme for the American system it would be met with resilience- like how Judges are blocking some of his non democratic executive orders causing him to rescind them altogether.


2. While Trump's leadership is somewhat unpredictable right now, the US is still the largest economy and military power. NATO still functions and has functioned fine without the US before. European reliance on US security is still active.


3. The idea that Trump is forcing Europe towards military independence is not really true. European nations have discussed reducing reliance on the US for decades, for example Macdon advocating for European strategic autonomy. If anything Trump might end up accelerating an inevitable shift rather than create a crisis.


4. Countries will continue to engage with the US as long as it remains economically and military viable. Even if trust is strained it is highly unlikely countries will sever ties with the US.


5. US will always attract top talent as long as technology advances. Even without the China tarrifs, push for US based semi conductor manufacturing has been growing for almost a decade now, and TSMC is set to open one of their largest plants in Arizona this year. With 2nm processes set to be manufactured there by 2027. US has some of the best colleges and minds in the world. Reproductive rights and gun rights might affect some, but it's not going to be something that affects things in the long run. US still has some of the best funding opportunities, career opportunities, and infrastructure opportunities in the world.


6. Trump's current president approach is rather erratic, but it is unlikely to lead to permanent international isolation. Nations will adapt to U.S. leadership under different administrations like they always have.


So while Trump's leadership may be unstable for now, it is definitely not the "downfall of the US" or "downfall of democracy" as people on Reddit put it. The idea the US will be permanently abandoned as a global leader because of one man's 4 year term is highly unlikely. I don't think his threats of military action against these counties are true, I think it is simply a way to get them to listen to him and take him seriously, but we will see.

Except these aren't any new issues that came into existence in the last two weeks and aren't even true for the most part. Live in California and you're going to have access to abortion just fine. And a higher salary is a good indication that your quality of life is going to be better as well.
When you zoom out to include the root of it, though, it'll be Reagan. Dude told Americans "you should be suspicious of your government, actually, especially when it wants to do things for the common good." And promptly went about dismantling said government (except for when it came to the security state and all the departments necessary for repression).
I was talking to a friend yesterday and he used the term 'reactionary' to describe conservative political parties. I thought about this more, and yeah, he's right. Our current administration here in the US is a large radical rejection of the longer progressive push in social issues within the last 60 years or so. That being said, I think this is definitely a step back and will most certainly make cracks in our relationships with other countries, but I think that the next four years are a symptom of some greater progress that has been made in social politics specifically.  

It's important that we keep our eyes on target and don't completely give in. My prediction is that the next four years will be a flash in the pan resulting from long strides too quickly, if that makes sense. Open to thoughts on this.
Military: No one comes closer to US military spending. China is a distant best. US airforce is the world's biggest air force. The second biggest air force in the world is US Navy. US air carrier capacity is twice than rest of the world combined. 

Economy: US is the world's reserve currency and richest nation in the history of the world. US told the world money we print is equivalent to gold and everyone is ok with it. 

Technology: Almost all critical tech is invented in US and produced in other countries. Which other countries make ground breaking discoveries in science? 

Culture: Name me 10 biggest actors/actress of any other country except your home country that most people would know. Hollywood is the leader in culture. Everyone in the world knows about America way more than regular Americans think. BLM happened across the world. Why would other countries care about a police arrest gone wrong? That's cultural supremacy.

My only argument here is that you seem to have narrowed your focus to attracting foreign minds. 

Consider how many Americans now want to leave the US. Trump supporters won’t be the people moving away, for many obvious reasons — it’ll be people who have the education and money to do so. The brain drain could happen faster than “inevitably,” if you have the double whammy of qualified Americans leaving and others not coming.
There are two areas where there is an enduring American control, and there is not much threat to it right now. 

First is the US dollar. It is the most liquid and safe money in the world. Every possible competitor has pretty fatal flaws. China will not be a standard because the money is not trustworthy to be free of manipulation and confiscation. It is used primarily as a way to access the Chinese market. The Euro is too vulnerable to crisis, as the market is not unified enough to make it a solid currency area. 2008 proved that the ECB has to save the weakest country to prevent a crisis. The UK is a basket case. Crypto is vulnerable to dark pools and deflation. 

The US banking system basically controls the international economy. Without access, a business is stuck on the world stage. 

The other is technology. The only serious competitor is China, but it has limits due to the interference of the state. Any business using Chinese tech knows that the government probably has access, and that you can't cross them.
