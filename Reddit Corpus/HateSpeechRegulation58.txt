Huh, I knew a Corbin that was a Nazi that went to my high school in Pennsylvania.  He's the right age too!  I wonder if it's him.   If it is, it means the guy's been sticking to his Nazi guns for over a decade at this point.  But he never antagonized me (Muslim) or the black kids.  He'd be like "I'm a Nazi and think you should be exterminated" and then just have no problems having a regular conversation about nonsense with you.  No one really took him seriously.  Strange guy, I suppose.

Edit: nvm, i did some cyberstalking and the guy from my high school was a Korbin not a Corbin.
There is just no estimating the stupidity of people. Why would someone make such a photo AND then post it on line/social media. Irrespective of the ignorance of the hate,intolerance and bigotry and possible wishing to do harm to others... We are free to our own opinions (not mine) or to hate (or love) whoever we want for whatever reason,  it becomes illegal only when someone takes or advocates action based on it.

 But what kind of stupid does it take to post such stuff on social media. But then if we jailed people for stupidity we would need to keep building prisons forever more.
For anyone who thinks this is just about freeze peach:

>Corbin Kauffman, 30, used aliases to post hundreds of racist, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic messages, images and videos, several of which contained threats, prosecutors said. Kauffman “expressed a desire to commit genocide and ‘hate crimes,’ and called for or depicted images of the killing of Jewish people, black people and Muslim people,” the U.S. attorney’s office in Scranton said in a news release.
