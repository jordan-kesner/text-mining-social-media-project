Title: CMV: it is perfectly reasonable of the ICC prosecutor to seek arrest warrants for leaders of Hamas *and* of Israel for alleged crimes against humanity

Post:
I’m feeling like the world has gone mad in its general reaction to this move by the ICC prosecutor.

We have Biden and others calling it outrageous to suggest equivalence between Israel and Hamas (which it would be) but that’s not at all what the ICC prosecutor has done - he’s just said ‘name’ is suspected of this list of bad things, and ‘name’ is suspected of this other list of bad things, with evidence, and those allegations are serious enough that there is potentially a case to answer. 

I’ve also seen people on Israeli subs saying although they might hate Netanyahu, the ICC has lost the plot. Like: ‘he’s a criminal but obviously not THAT kind of criminal!’, and saying the ICC should turn its attention to the real crims in Russia or North Korea instead. But, jurisdictional issues aside, why would you not want scrutiny of all leaders responsible for massive loss of life? Even the strongest supporter of Israel’s right to defend itself should surely be concerned about how exactly that defending is done? And there are lots of features of Israel’s warfare that should at least prompt cause for concern (disproportionate fatalities, friendly fire, dead aid workers, soldier misconduct)

Meanwhile Hamas says the move equates victim with executioner. Same point applies as above, that leaders on both sides might have some charges in common, but the question in each case is “did this person do this stuff?” NOT “is this person better/worse than that person?” Also I don’t believe there is any doubt that Hamas ordered deliberate killing of civilians and taking of hostages. The whole point of the concept of war crimes is that it doesn’t matter how righteous or justified you feel, or how nasty war is - you should never do them. 

Are we really so addicted to “good guy vs bad guy” narratives that we can’t bend our minds around the concept that maybe two sides, despite all sorts of legitimate grievances, can simultaneously inflict great evils on one another?

Is it perhaps that it’s such a complex situation the moderates stay quiet so the polar extremes dominate the airtime?

Or am I missing something here? I see no sensible reason for calling the ICC’s (very preliminary) move anything other than reasonable, or anything short of exactly what we should want to see in modern civilisation.

The ICC can only issue arrest warrants in cases where it's certain the judicial system of a country won't prosecute their desired target. 

For Hamas, it's pretty clear. No Palestinian court would ever prosecute Hamas' leaders, nor would they ever be in Palestine to be prosecuted by them, as they all live in Qatar.  

Considering Netanyahu is **currently under trial** in Israel for corruption charges, by all definitions, and that Israeli officials were scheduled to meet with an ICC delegation **the same day** as when the statement came out (the delegation canceled) its clear as day that Israel is both capable and willing to prosecute such crimes itself. By still trying to prosecute Netanyahu despite that, the ICC is not only acting in bad faith (canceling scheduled meetings and investigations with Israel to make an entirelt one-sided move against them), its also extending its own jurisdiction, entirely ignoring the limits that were set in place for it.  

I suggest you read Blinken's statement on it. It explains pretty thoroughly why this is an outrage.
I almost would rather them issue warrants for Sinwar and Haniyeh first, then come back and issue warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant later if they want to. The act of issuing them at the same time really makes it seem like the court is trying to give the impression that there's equivalency to their actions (look at all the headlines just saying that warrants have been issued on both sides for war crimes). I think the ICC and ICJ have done a bad job at disincentivizing lawfare in the future. Do you want to go commit some war crimes? Well just make sure you hide behind your civilians afterwards so that the other guy gets arrested as well. 

If Netanyahu and Gallant are arrested on war crimes and there is compelling evidence, then I support throwing the book at them. I just feel like the international community has really enabled lawfare in this conflict because Israel is the larger and stronger party to the conflict
Honestly they are going to show just how useless this is pretty much immediately simply because Palestine is a member of the ICC and therefore needs to arrest Sinwar, we all know that is not going to happen. 

It's just virtue signaling on a really grand level and all that is going to come out of it is heightened tending in the area and extra barriers to any sort of ongoing peace.
I think there's a larger issue some people are missing here (FYI I'm Israeli and a leftist). It's not a political, moral or legal issue but a practical one.

Any political commentator in Israel would tell you that these charges are an absolute nightmare for Israeli politicians (except for alt-right settlers like Ben Gvir). Politicians, military generals, low ranking commanders and even nobodies like me are terrified of being remotely associated with crimes like the ones attributed now to Netanyahu and Gallant.

Most public servants had a false assumption that the complementarity principal and our domestic courts will shield them from any such culpability. They were now proven wrong, and will start to gradually back down from positions that have that kind of legal exposure. Contrary to what you might believe, there are many, many leftists in our military. They will leave even if they took every measure to protect civilians.

You know who's gonna stay? Who isn't scared of the ICC? The Ben Gvir gang. They'll stop approving Palestinian construction in area C, loosen the army's laws of engagement, re-outlaw the Palestinian flag, and before you know it they're annexing Ramallah. And that's leaving out the legal status of homosexuality and abortions. They aren't scared, because in their mind the ICC is out to get us. They think they'll get prosecuted anyway, so might as well do whatever.

The ICC charges are sending the message that even if you send hundreds of flour and lentils trucks across the border - you'll get accused of purposefully causing a famine. Plays right into the alt-right's agenda.
>but that’s not at all what the ICC prosecutor has done - he’s just said ‘name’ is suspected of this list of bad things, and ‘name’ is suspected of this other list of bad things, with evidence, and those allegations are serious enough that there is potentially a case to answer.

Well, no. He didn't just say that, he sought warrants for the arrest of Netanyahu and Gallant on those charges. He's not leaving an uniformed Reddit comment accusing someone a war crimes. He's seeking to have the Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of a sovereign state arrested for war crimes and crimes against humanity. 

>I’ve also seen people on Israeli subs saying although they might hate Netanyahu, the ICC has lost the plot. Like: ‘he’s a criminal but obviously not THAT kind of criminal!’, and saying the ICC should turn its attention to the real crims in Russia or North Korea instead. But, jurisdictional issues aside, why would you not want scrutiny of all leaders responsible for massive loss of life?

Again, this isn't just scrutiny. This is asking a court to issue warrants for an arrest. And given that multiple sources has claimed that Khan was supposed to go to Israel to meet with representatives of the government to further investigate these assertions but instead decided to go forward with seeking the arrest warrants without doing so, if that's an accurate summation of the situation, that calls into question if that scrutiny is actually being undertaken. 

>The whole point of the concept of war crimes is that it doesn’t matter how righteous or justified you feel, or how nasty war is - you should never do them. 

Ya, that's how crimes work.
I don't get the whole "equivalence" thing.  The ICC is not calling or treating them equivalent or in any way comparing the defendants to each other.  

They are each being charged separately and individually for the crimes they have committed, such as rape, murder or intentional starving of civilians.  Their laundry list of violations do not read the same, nor do they mention the others.
The ICC [is designed to be a court of last resort. ](https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/the-court) It "[it seeks to complement, not replace, national Courts](https://www.icc-cpi.int/)". 

Israel has its own legal system. It investigated Ariel Sharon, the defense minister during the First Lebanon war,  and his responsibility for the [Sabra and Shatila Massacre ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_Commission). The IDF Chief of Staff and the Director of Military Intelligence were also investigated.

While there can be a discussion if Israel should be investigating itself, or if any government should investigate itself (or if having a supranational body in charge of all investigations violates state sovereignty), for the ICC to charge Israel before it has had a chance to investigate its own conduct is violating the ICCs own mandate of being 'the court of last resort '. 

(And if someone can give me an example of Hamas or the PA conducting investigations into the conduct of high ranking officers or politicians, I would say the same for them.)
There are several reasons why this decision is outrageous:

1. Israel has a strong and independent judicial system, both inside the military and for the country. This system was already investigating and ruled in some cases. On this merit alone- and due to the complementary principle of the ICC there is no reason to investigate Israel.

2. For the allegations themselves- they have no real merit. Starvation for example has no factual basis. Since the early days of the war Israel allowed aid into Gaza, through Egypt and air drops, and later through Israel land crossings and even a dock with the US.

3. The ICC jurisdiction is in question- that is because israel is not a part to the convention, and neither Hamas nor Palestine are considered a country or a part to this convention.

4. The ICC and the Israeli authorities were in serious discussions, including a delegation coming to Israel at the exact same time of the announcement (which cancelled their visit) and for the prosecutor himself to arrive by next week- at the very least there is a serious case of bad faith.

Last but not least- the actual implications are strictly one sided- the motion for arrest warrants was issued for 5 people, 3 of them are never going to leave the tunnels of the Gaza strip alive, or get anywhere outside of an Israeli court and prison if they will be caught alive. The other two are a democratic nations PM and minister, which actually mean they should be traveling around in order to work, and part of that work is to end the Gaza war faster to prevent more suffering.
