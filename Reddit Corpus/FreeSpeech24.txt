Title: Limiting free speech under Project 2025

Post:
Social Media Censorship: Mentions that the government to get more involved in deciding what can and can’t be posted on social media. 

Speech on College Campuses: People think there’s too much liberal or left-wing speech on college campuses and want to change that. They might want to limit some types of speech they don’t agree with, which could make it harder for students to express their ideas freely.

Control Over the Media: They want the government to have more power over news outlets to make sure they follow certain rules or values. 

Like limiting expression of one self and what they want to do with their own bodies.

Haha the blue wolf ate a lot of people so the red wolf eating my people is justified. I am very smart!
So now that the other team is doing it you don’t care? It’s… almost like you didn’t care about the principle to begin with!
the left doesn't get anything done. But we know trumpo will get it done like the wall. Project 2025 is here.
Haha except the red wolf "eating my people" is imagined and when it's real then we can talk. Until then, enjoy your fanfic. 
What a dumb point and you thought you were being soo clever lmao.


I'll need to see it from the right, like I saw it from the left, which managed to turn me away after 14 years, or something. 


You hyperactive fear mongers aren't going to change my mind, when I see it for myself then I'll change my mind, thank you. 
You guys tried to make an internet censorship department three times under Biden. On Biden's third day in office he demanded private WhatsApp messages between individuals be censored.
