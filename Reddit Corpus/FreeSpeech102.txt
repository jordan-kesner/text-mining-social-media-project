Title: [META] Rule 7 is self-defeating (even if designed to be intentionally so) and shuts out valid discussion and debate.

Post:
I don't know if this post will get removed, but it will be even more ironic if it does. Perhaps some of you know I made a thread about this on another subreddit. I recently got [banned](https://i.imgur.com/ZdGGRky.png) for breaking rule 7 (a rule that I didn't even conceive of existing in a place like this). [The offending post](https://i.imgur.com/0nhxZPe.png). Now my ban has expired, I'd like to reply here. Rule 7 of the r/FreeSpeech subreddit is self-defeating and censorious. 

Now I'll say before all of this, before people (rather ironically point it out to me as I expect some will) that obviously the mod literally has the right to run this subreddit how he wants, and even run it in a way people consider hypocritical - but I simply want to express disagreement and query parts of the ruleset here, in particular: Rule 7.

Rule 7 is as follows:

**The following statements will result in a ban, as will logical variations of them:**

---

* Curation is not censorship
* Private companies should censor whoever they like
* Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences

---

First of all, we're all here to debate about this stuff - right? They're all related to issues surrounding free speech. Why are there presuppositions built into the subreddit that are not open for any kind of debate? That seems in itself at odds with the very premise of the subreddit. But let's go into the statements that apparently may not be questioned.

>Curation is not censorship

This seems an odd one. I suppose you could argue that it's censorship in a general sense - but what is the logic here behind banning this comment? Is the subreddit opposing this? How do you think hobbyist communities are supposed to work? Take r/metal for instance. I often use this as a go-to example. They have strict rules about genre and popularity in order to maintain the quality and utility of the subreddit. They use metal-archives standards regarding metal and reject nu-metal and (most) forms of metalcore as subgenres of metal. They also have popularity and repost rules for posts to ensure the same popular bands like Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer etc don't completely overwhelm the subreddit. This is curation. Is this supposed to be bad? Should r/metal have no restrictions and allow anyone to post whatever they like regardless of its relevance and repetition?

>Private companies should censor whoever they like

This particular part of the rule is self-defeating, as banning anyone for saying this is in effect affirming the statements validity as you would necessarily believe your own space has valid reasons to censor specific viewpoints. Presumably the mods should serve themselves a ban for acting on it. The mod banning people purely for stating this type of comment, whatever reason he gives is by consequence acting as if "Private companies should censor whoever they like" is true. Clearly he thinks that in some cases, it is appropriate for private companies (or volunteers acting within them) to censor content by means of banning people who express certain ideas. If I challenge him on this rule, and he defends it - is he not at that point effectively conceding that "Private companies should censor whoever they like". By enforcing the rule, he's effectively forcing himself into a position where he has to defend what it purports to ban.

Indeed, it seems [he believes](https://old.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/1c6odzp/i_will_soon_be_banning_people_for_using_slurs_and/lljqc1z/) that it is or can be appropriate for private spaces to ban people for what they say and invokes the argument employed by progressives when they talk about the "paradox of tolerance" or "tolerance of intolerance" when they draw up rules to regulate hate speech, or speech otherwise identified as 'extremism'. It's 'required' to protect freedom of speech, as he's doing here (by his logic).

What makes his reasons for banning certain avenues of discussion more valid than any other subreddit or community removing content? Or any other platform removing comment? Any community or company that bans specific forms of expression will claim to do so for justified reasons. You may disagree with them, but that's just your opinion - as it is theirs, as it is the mods here.

The framing of this particular part of the rule is also clunky. I don't think anyone thinks that any company **should** just ban whatever they want for any or no reason. Websites and companies get criticised all the time rightly and wrongly for this stuff.  There's a difference here between **should** and **could**. I think r/freespeech has every legal right to operate hypocritically and inconsistently. I don't think they **should** but they can do so if they want too. There is a difference here. But where are we going with this anyway? Are we saying that in an ideal world every single private platform would be forbidden by law to censor anyone? They would have no control over their platform? This is usually the context in which people say this stuff here - when someone expresses grievance with being banned from a particular subreddit or privately run community. This deserves some discussion, surely - freedom of association is absolutely an important right that has a relation to free speech and civil liberties in general. Compelled speech, compelled platforming is just as much an issue when it comes to freedom of speech as anything else. Should LGBT groups be forced to platform and put up with anti-LGBT activists and antagonists? Should Christian forums and platforms be compelled to platform and argue with anti-theists? What level of self-moderation are platforms, or ought they be allowed?

Like I fundamentally get grievances when major platforms in ostensibly neutral zones engage in partisan moderation. There are issues here. But I do not understand this when it comes to topical communities or political communities that by design have an inherent community or bias to maintain their topic focus and theme.

>Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences

I don't get what this is even going for. All people mean by consequences is that when you say something, people may react negatively to it. This seems self-evident on the basis that we form opinions of people based on what they say. If I insult someone, they may not like me and not want to be around me. If I start insulting my co-workers, I might end up getting warned and fired. That's a /consequence/. Is r/freespeech taking the position that this should not happen? Why is noting this in any sense somehow grounds for a ban? Just by r/FreeSpeech banning me for 3 days, I received consequences for my speech. Doesn't the fact that r/FreeSpeech bans people for this validate the statement?

If you want to make the argument that people's employment, financial and housing situations should not be able to be weakened because of expressed political opinions - then sure, I can see sense in some regulation that mitigates this (and there is already a lot of this) - but at the very minimum, it's impossible for something you say not potentially having some social or professional consequences. 


If the moderators here genuinely believe that banning someone for their expressed opinion in an online community constitutes a violation of speech and a form of censorship, then by their logic the enforcement of this rule is an infringement of speech, thus validating the statement that "Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences".

----

I'll also make a prediction that a lot of free-speech absolutist types who I know participate here (not the mod, by his own admission who seems to have his own blue-and-orange position on this) who believe all censorship on private platforms is unjustified will suddenly find some reason to endorse rule 7. 

In fact, anyone arguing in favour of Rule 7 on grounds of "his space, his rules" must be banned for saying it.

> Is the subreddit opposing this? [censorship]

No, the subreddit is not opposing all censorship.

However, censorship has to be recognized for what it is, and hiding behind a euphemism allows people to pretend that curation and censorship are different things, which is a thought-terminating cliche.

>  Presumably the mods should serve themselves a ban for acting on [Rule #7]

I've tried it, but reddit does not actually allow mods to ban themselves.

> If I challenge him on this rule, and he defends it - is he not at that point effectively conceding that "Private companies should censor whoever they like"

You're missing important context here, which is that there are a whole lot of people in here I'd like to ban, yet feel that I cannot because this sub is called FreeSpeech.  Rule #7 was created because I have come to believe that the three forbidden ideas, being thought-terminating cliches, are actively injurious to the cause of FreeSpeech itself.

Viz., I have to restrict free speech to save it.

> All people mean by consequences is that when you say something, people may react negatively to it.

"Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences" is a thought-terminating cliche.  Its utterance invites the reader to dismiss those consequences, because those consequences could have been predicted by the speaker.

What it does not do is inspire the reader to understand whether those consequences were justified, or even just.

> In fact, anyone arguing in favour of Rule 7 on grounds of "his space, his rules" must be banned for saying it.

No, not at all.  I reserve the right to mod this place as I see fit, and not all violations of Rule #7 are banned, depending upon my subjective evaluation of the effect on the discussion.
I think it's important to remind folks that this sub is about discussion of free speech topics, not strictly about reddit or other social media platforms.   Nor is it "say whatever you want".

So some limits on content are necessary, particularly those that have been discussed ad infinitum without the possibility of resolution.
I'll also add that I'm not being just completely contrarian here. I saw the no-blocking rule in the rules too, which I can understand somewhat.
>However, censorship has to be recognized for what it is, and hiding behind a euphemism allows people to pretend that curation and censorship are different things, which is a thought-terminating cliche.

I don't recall denying that it was censorship.

>I've tried it, but reddit does not actually allow mods to ban themselves.

You see my point though?

>You're missing important context here, which is that there are a whole lot of people in here I'd like to ban, yet feel that I cannot because this sub is called FreeSpeech.

So ironically this is just the "paradox of tolerance" but for your specific pet issue. As I said in my post.

I don't at all see how they're "thought-terminating cliches". 

>"Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences" is a thought-terminating cliche. Its utterance invites the reader to dismiss those consequences, because those consequences could have been predicted by the speaker.

Not necessarily at all. The purpose in saying it is that you cannot control how someone else may react to what you say. Their reaction is every much an aspect of free speech as the act of you saying it.

>What it does not do is inspire the reader to understand whether those consequences were justified, or even just.

I see no reason whatsoever to come to this conclusion. You can believe the consequences that someone suffers due to what they say are unjustified whilst also conceding that the person who inflicted them on the others may well have the right to cause them. Such as my own ban here for instance. That was **consequence** of a rule that I regarded as unjustified and contrary to the spirit of the subreddit (and itself).

>No, not at all. I reserve the right to mod this place as I see fit, and not all violations of Rule #7 are banned, depending upon my subjective evaluation of the effect on the discussion.

Your capriciousness aside - by the letter of the rule, anyone arguing in favour of it in theory should be banned by you.
>I think it's important to remind folks that this sub is about discussion of free speech topics, not strictly about reddit or other social media platforms. Nor is it "say whatever you want".

I never at any point suggested that I think it is, or should be. I am talking about a specific rule that specifically restricts how topics related to free speech may come up.

>So some limits on content are necessary, particularly those that have been discussed ad infinitum without the possibility of resolution.

You don't think discussions around forced platforming and freedom of association are valid aspects surrounding free expression?
> I don't recall denying that it was censorship.

I am clarifying your misunderstanding.  This subreddit is not against all censorship, contrary to your statement.

> So ironically this is just the "paradox of tolerance" but for your specific pet issue. As I said in my post.

What's wrong with irony?

> I don't at all see how they're "thought-terminating cliches". 

You haven't been watching these arguments go by on reddit for seventeen years.

> Your capriciousness aside - by the letter of the rule, anyone arguing in favour of it in theory should be banned by you.

Fortunately I don't abide by the letter of the law, I moderate subjectively, as I have already stated.
