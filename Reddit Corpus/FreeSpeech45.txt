For the past few months this subreddit has been astro turfed by "Yang Gang" shills from YangForPresidentHQ. They argue that Yang's UBI plan, the "Freedom" Dividend, a massive new welfare plan funded by a huge tax increase (a Value Added Tax) is somehow libertarian. They also take Milton Friedman out of context and claim he would have supported Yang's plan (Friedman supported UBI replacing all other welfare, including Medicare and Social Security). Ignoring the obvious statist implications of Yang's "Freedom" Dividend plan, Yang supports several other statist policies such as...

*Draconian new gun control laws

*Medicare for All

*Having the government spend $1 trillion on infrastructure

*Paid family leave

*Further regulating private companies by mandating a paid leave policy

*"Free marriage counseling for all"

*"Free financial counseling for all"

*"Free early childhood education for all"

*Implementing a new "financial transactions" tax

*Raising the capital gains tax

*Implementing a massive new value added tax, as mentioned above

*Boosting government spending on the arts

*Boost government spending on vocational schools

*Lowering the voting age to 16

*Creating a federal department to regulate smart phones and social media, for the children of course

*Forcing the NCAA to pay college athletes

*Creating a crony capitalist slush fund to incentivize using empty shopping malls

*Forcing universities to pay a portion of their endowment to fund a new university in Ohio

*Creating a new "public council of advisors"

*Having the government pay journalists to combat "fake news"

*Free speech violating "campaign finance reform"

So if you see a Yang shill from r/YangforPresidentHQ, feel free to steal this and remind them why Yang is not a choice for libertarians whatsoever. In my opinion, the only person libertarians should vote for in 2020 is the Libertarian Party Candidate.

I like Yang as a person. He's a nice guy. He's not libertarian, he's a democtratic technocrat. He has some good critiques, and a few good ideas, but he's not a libertarian.
I‚Äôm probably out of my depth and about to get schooled, but wasn‚Äôt Friedman‚Äôs version of UBI essentially a graduated tax rebate? This is really like a better structured welfare system that changes the incentives around work. And I seem to remember him proposing it begrudgingly; more like if we‚Äôre going to have a welfare state this version would have a better outcome. It‚Äôs always confused me when people say he supported UBI.
I like Yang because he thinks about the future, but he‚Äôs not libertarian at all. I would love for him to have a voice in government, just not the loudest voice.
I am in complete agreement that Yang is not a Libertarian, yet I personally believe he has qualities more candidates should have.

For example, Yang supports his claims with evidence (ex. He provides facts and stats on how automation will lead to unemployment and that‚Äôs why he wants to implement his freedom dividend). I noticed most Democratic candidates provide vague and sweeping promises and no policy proposals. Yang, on the other hand, at least provides evidence for his reasoning, and for most policy areas, has a plan.

And I am open to hearing all arguments regarding UBI, yet I would like to point out that Milton Friedman was one of the biggest advocates for it. Of course, Friedman was in favor of UBI replacing our current welfare system, whereas Yang wants to add UBI in addition to the broken welfare system.
