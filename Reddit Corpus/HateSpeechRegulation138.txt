Title: If you had to delete one social media app, which one would it be and why ?

Post:
I deleted Instagram because I realized it was having a negative impact on my mental health. I found myself constantly comparing my life to others, even though I knew on some level that what people post isn't always the full picture. It was draining and left me feeling inadequate or disconnected from my own reality.

I also noticed I was spending way too much time scrolling, which was taking away from things that actually mattered to me. I felt like I was missing out on the present moment, always distracted by my phone. I needed to get that time back and put it toward things that bring me joy or help me grow.

Overall, deleting Instagram gave me a sense of freedom. It allowed me to reconnect with myself and focus on what truly makes me happy without the noise of social media in the background. It’s been such a positive shift, and I’m really glad I made the decision.

I deleted them all. It’s just people fighting with each other, people portraying fake lives, and sad news. I found myself getting anxious, angry, and depressed. It ALL had to go. 

Now I fill my spare time with reading, word games, and researching the things that interest me.
Instagram is where humans go to get programmed. Phones make this possible. A stream of information flows through the screen, shapes the mind, our behaviour, our wants and desires. It keeps us there, drains us, feeds on our attention and our time.
I've recently pulled away from Instagram and my life already feels like it's getting better. I was spending too much time doom scrolling and getting caught up in petty discussions about things I couldn't change. 

At one point I was focused on getting followers, building community and getting exposure for my art. Then I realised how many people out there just care about themselves and what they can get from you, and I found myself constantly feeling like I was either playing catch-up or like actual shit. 

None of it is real. I have met some amazing people over the years but the ones I care about, I'll continue to speak with offline, and they've already left the platform anyway. My mental health isn't worth staying on there.
I deleted Twitter because Twatzis are bad for everyone’s health. I’d delete Facebook for the same reason if I didn’t have company pages to run. 

In general though, deleting the Facebook app off my phone was best for me to avoid getting sucked into the time waste that are never ending videos.
I have to use them all for business reasons, so I'm stuck for now. But I've reduced Twitter to be my least frequently used app, and I no longer spend ad dollars there.
Incredible! You must be so proud of yourself, you've done what many want to do but can't quite execute. Thanks for sharing your inspiring journey
I deleted everything but reddit and YouTube. I have a 2 hr a day limit on reddit because social media effects my mental health. I watch "trash TV", smosh and art video on YouTube so it can stay for now.
