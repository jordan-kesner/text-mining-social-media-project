I don't really understand why this would help Trump... If Twitter becomes liable for what is being posted, wouldn't that mean Twitter would start censoring more? And probably censoring the president more?

I'm confused...
Up until now, he's been Twitter's biggest performer and draw. Kicking Trump off Twitter would have been bad for business.

Except now it would be FANTASTIC for business if there was a media spectacle around banning him. Hell, I'd watch that on pay-per-view!
Gets fact checked, throws temper tantrum and one of the fastest turn-arounds on an executive order ever.  We got police killing black people, riots, and a pandemic but clearly twitter is what our dear leader is focused on
Pretty sure that if Trump tries to censure Twitter. Twitter will sue and any judge in the country would rule in Twitter's favor before they finish their morning coffee.
Am I reading this wrong, or does that mean that the people Trump slanders constantly can now sue him for libel?
He's trying to erode the first amendment and the personal liberty that your country was based on. Its an intentional sensational distraction. 

The country he leads has over 101,000 dead since January and all he needs to do is save face for a few months to win an election.

Stay focused.
