Title: The left knows they lost the debate last night so the only thing related to it you see online is the fly that landed on Mike’s head. The right does the same.

They both do the same thing. When one side KNOWS they’ve lost an argument they go to mockery and insulting each other to cover up the fact that they took a punch and neither side has the pride to admit their faults. Okay sure a fly landed on his head haha! Why don’t we actually talk about policy?

Neither candidate answered every question but Pence was slightly better about it.  Kamala was a fucking joke not saying if she would support a national mask mandate or a new green deal.
They were both better in relation to trump v Biden, but question avoiding on both sides is evident of democrats and republicans being dishonest and subversive in politics.
