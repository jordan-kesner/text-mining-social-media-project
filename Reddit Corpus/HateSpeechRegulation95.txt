Title: Freelance Package Pricing? 

Post:
Hey there! Hoping to get some feedback on pricing and estimated hours for a freelance project I'm considering taking on. Here are the details:

- Deloping a comprehensive social strategy with goals/KPIs, competitive analysis, content pillars, platform-specific tactics for a catering company active on 3 platforms. They have provided some suggested content themes, list of competitors 

- Additionally, I will create a content calendar framework for their upcoming year to streamline their content planning process.

- I will also provide post ideas (without content creation) for the first half of Q1, including content themes, inspiration pics, and concepts.

The client has requested completion within three weeks, acknowledging that I'll be working on this project during evenings/weekends due to my full-time job commitment.

 This is my first freelance project, and although I have experience creating strategies in-house, I anticipate a learning curve as I familiarize myself with the brand and market landscape.

Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Congrats on your first freelance project! For something as detailed as a full strategy, competitive analysis, content pillars, platform tactics, and a content calendar framework, I’d estimate around 25–35 hours depending on the learning curve. Pricing-wise, a ballpark could be $1,500–$2,000+ depending on your experience and market rates—it’s a lot of strategic value. Since it’s your first project, consider starting on the lower end to build your portfolio but don’t undervalue your time and expertise. Good luck!
