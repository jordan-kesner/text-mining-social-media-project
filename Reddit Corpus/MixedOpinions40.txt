Title: CMV: Antifa warrants more mainstream attention.

Post:
Obligitory: I'm not a Nazi or alt-right supporter, I hate white supremacists and may a million stray cats piss on their unmarked graves in the years to come. 

Well, with that out of the way, I'd like to assert that our national discourse surrounding the dangers of the far-right has drowned out a potential discussion that we *should* be having about the dangers of the far-left. This is not to say we should cease discussing the far-right, nor to argue that one is worse than the other; I certainly have my opinion on that subject, but it's a discussion for another CMV on another day. 

I was at a dinner party with lots of friends and family (of all ages) recently and we were discussing Trump, the events at Charlottesville, etc. (except those at the kids table, who were engaged in a competition involving blowing bubbles into their juice-boxes). After this went on for a while and at some point I said something like, "And what do you all think of Antifa?" ... *crickets* ... "What's that, now?" came the eventual reply. Nearly two dozen young people, adults, and seniors were present, and while all of them were well versed in the various ins and outs of the far-right, the alt-right, and the resurgence of the Nazi/white supremacist/white nationalist movement than their relation to current politics, not one of them even knew the *name* of their left-leaning counterpart, much less the significance of that counterpart. How can this be? 

Now, I do live in the Bay Area, which is astoundingly liberal. I've only heard the Antifa subject covered a few times on local major news outlets, and it's usually just a 5min excerpt of some expert telling us why they're not all that bad, or are actually quite virtuous, while many of those same outlets *still* bring up the evil Nazis at Charlottesville on a daily basis. I know things are likely different in other parts of the country, but from what I can tell from conversing with my friends in more conservative-dominated areas, none of them are unaware of the resurgent existence and danger of the far-right, so why are folks in liberal areas unaware of the resurgent existence and danger of the far-left? 

Why do I think that Antifa is bad? Well the first reason would have to be tactics; from the "Antifa" wiki:

>The Antifa (English: /ænˈtiːfə/ or /ˈæntiˌfɑː/)[1] movement is a conglomeration of autonomous, self-styled anti-fascist groups in the United States.[2][3][4] The principal feature of antifa groups is their opposition to fascism through the use of direct action.[5] They engage in militant protest tactics, which has included property damage and physical violence.[2][6][7][8] They tend to be anti-capitalist[9] and they are predominantly far-left and militant left,[10][5] which includes anarchists, communists and socialists.[11][12][13][14] Their stated focus is on fighting far-right and white supremacist ideologies directly, rather than politically.[5]

As a general rule, I think that civilians taking matters into their own hands, using violence, arson, and intimidation to shut up other people is a bad thing. 

Now, I'm also generally *less* strong on that stance when it comes to Nazis... *But:*

1) A bunch of inbred morons waving tiki-torches in Charlottesville, or Spencer spewing his noxious filth to a dozen people on a sidewalk, do not constitute a direct threat to your freedom and safety, much less ours as a nation. We're a long way off from that in any kind of meaningful, life-altering way. If we even *start* to get to the point where KKK members are patrolling the streets, and Nazis are dragging blacks and Jews out of their house in the middle of the night, you bet your ass I'll be there, guns blazing, fists connecting with Nazi cheekbones until they take me down!! ... apologies for the dramatic flair, but you get my point: when (really, "if" (*BIG* "if")) this shit ever really hits the fan, I'm in full support of violence, because then the violence isn't preemptive, it's defensive. As it stands, 99.9% of Antifa violence is preemptive, which I'm not okay with. 

2) Antifa has repeatedly demonstrated a *woefully* inadequate ability (or interest) to contain their activities to countering *actual* fascists. The two most clear-cut examples of this would be the way they handled speeches by Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos, namely by assaulting people, occupying buildings, making threats, and burning shit down... all to stop two of the guys (I mean, a Jew who was the target of the most anti-Semitic hate speech in 2017 and a guy who is a gay Jew who loves sucking black dicks) who are quite possibly the *furthest* thing from dyed-in-the-wool Nazis as you could possibly hope for. What Ben and Milo *are*, however, is conservatives, and that seems to be plenty enough reason for Antifa to get involved to shut them down. That, again, I'm *not* okay with. If Antifa actually had the willingness, restraint, or ability to confine their violence to *actual* fascists, I might not have *as much* of a problem with them. But they don't. Hell, they were just as active in trying to shut down an anti-Communist rally that specifically *condemned* white fascists and said they were unwelcome. But again, it doesn't really matter if this "Anti-Fascist" movement is targeting *actual* fascists; anyone they disagree with for any reason seems to be fair game. Despite their name, their motives are *clearly* not restrained to just countering actual fascists. If you haven't already, I encourage you to go look up the full recordings of some of Ben and Milo's speeches at various campuses. You might very well disagree with every word, I know I certainly disagree with quite a few, but are they saying things that blood needs to be spilt and hundreds of thousands of dollars of property damage needs to be inflicted to prevent (or hundreds of thousands of dollars in security for a 2hr event needs to be paid for in order to prevent said blood and destruction)? I'd argue no. And if you agree with that, then Antifa is an issue, because they're the ones spilling blood, buring shit, and necessitating said security. 

3) Beyond just being (or claiming to be) anti-Fascist, much of the Antifa movement is also heavily Socialist/Anarchist/Communist, the latter in particular being an ideology not much better (or perhaps worse) than fascism. It'd be one thing if Antifa was just a group of people dedicated to fighting fascism, but they have their own political agenda that's backed by ideologies just as toxic as the one they want to fight. The irony that they arrive at rallies and protests where dipshits are waving Swastika flags, while they're carrying flags bearing the Hammer and Sickle (one of the few symbols representing a government that actually surpassed Nazism in the "who can make the biggest mountain of corpses" competition) seems entirely lost on them. Instead of just fighting a murderous ideology, which would be fine, they instead have to *also* advocate for their own, different murderous ideology. Again, they mobilized to attack and shut down a rally that was just anti-Communist, not pro-Fascist (and in fact explicitly *anti*-fascist). So what gives? 

For these reasons, I think it's important for the American populace to be aware that left-wing extremism exists in the same way we already all seem to know the right-wing kind exists. Both extreme groups have demonstrated their ability to turn whole countries into totalitarian hellholes, and even domestically both have established their ability to kill American civilians. And yet we only ever seem to hear about the right-wing iteration of this stuff. Antifa, and the dangers of the non-explicitly-anti-fascist ideologies they espouse, should be common knowledge among the American people, in the way far-right threats are. The next time I mention "Antifa" at a dinner party (when the subject is up, obviously; I'm not one for ruining dinner parties with dreary and depressing political topics) the response should be like "Oh I know what that is, here's my opinion on how that group factors into national politics etc. etc." instead of, as appears to be the case, folks being so sheltered from it that they aren't even aware it exists. 

Now, just to preempt some potential replies that I really won't find all that convincing:

"But Antifa is just a loose organization of people with varying beliefs."

So? You can say that about Nazis/KKK members/white supremacists/white nationalists, too. All of those groups have varying ideologies which, while I detest them all, it's hard not to admit some of them are lesser evils: I'd *much* prefer those white dudes advocating for "separate but equal" rather than "lynch all the Jews and blacks." In regards to their level of organization, just like the aforementioned white groups, Antifa has meetings, groups, news outlets, web pages, Facebook accounts, crowd-funding ability, *college clubs* (that's one the white racists can't really claim), professionally made flags and banners, and has repeatedly demonstrated their ability to mobilize hundreds if not thousands of (often armed and armored) individuals to descend on any area they choose. They're at least as well-defined and organized as the groups they claim to oppose. 

"Their bad actions are just the actions of individuals, not a bad group."

Bollocks. If that were the case, we'd have to be accepting of white nationalism since only a few bad actors of said movement have ever done anything bad. 

"Communism isn't as bad as fascism."

Well, like I said, I'm not really interested in getting into a pissing contest about which is worse. And, in fact, I completely sympathize with the apparent reality that most people find blatant murderous racism more egregious than blatant murderous classism. I get that. Doesn't mean that both ideologies don't have tens of millions of skeletons in their closets. 

"That wasn't real communism."

Neither here nor there, even though this counter seems to always come up in these discussions. In any case, Antifa isn't waving around flags with Marx's face, they're waving around flags with the symbol of the USSR. You can support the "ideal, as of yet ever actually realized" version of communism, but if you support the actions of the USSR, something aint right. Supporting communism =/= waving about the flag of the USSR. 

"We have to be intolerant of intolerance."

As said above, if we get to the point where the intolerant people actually pose some kind of real threat to our way of life, I'm down with your intolerance of their intolerance, and will participate in its violent conclusion. But as it stands, as a nation, white supremacists are more like that crazy dude on the subway rambling about how Jews are ruing the nation. Is the appropriate response to beat the living shit out of the guy, or just let him pass? I get that some poor soul is dead in Virginia because of these fucks. Let us never forget it. But left-wing violence is *also* a thing, and we need to be cognizant of that. And even if it wasn't, one Neo-Nazi dipshit driving his car into a crowd of people, while absolutely horrible, doesn't constitute a threat to the American way of life as a whole. If it did, we'd be just as well employed advocating "punch a BLM supporter" because of the actions of one individual in Dallas, Texas in 2016. We need to be able to isolate the norm from the extreme without causing a panic. 

As for what *would* change my view, mainly some good reason why it *wouldn't* be a net benefit for "Antifa," and the toxic, non-fascist-fighting values they espouse, to be household concepts in this country. And, obviously, some other good counter that I haven't considered. 

Ya'll know what to do. Cheers.

Anti-fascist movements aren't new and the usually flare up with an uptick in right-wing activities. Anti-fascist action has been a tactic since the 1930's and it has never really posed a significant threat to anyone but nazis. We are currently in a time when nazi and far-right organizing is surging in a way that it hasn't in the last couple of decades. Ergo people on the Left are concerned and want to take action to disrupt hate rallies and Nazi organizers. That's not a very threatening civil action.

A deeper question is when should we organize against the far right. This was a fundamental failing of both liberal and left-wing groups in 1930's, they only focused their attention on the laughable, marginal Nazis when they were no longer marginal. Far-right messaging is getting people elected. Whether it is Trump in America, Golden Dawn in Greece, or Le Pen in France. These groups are sympathetic to the far-right, supportive of racist policies, and generally authoritarian. I don't want to get into the weeds of why left-wing organizing isn't nearly as bad as far-right organizing, because the fact of the matter is that the right is generally stronger than the Left. The right-wing is moving farther right and this is a tactic that is working. Ergo the far-right is of significantly more interest to drive contemporary politics than the far-left right now. 
So first off, your post really stems from your own anecdotal experience. I would argue that Antifa garners far more mainstream attention than they deserve.

In conservative circles on November 5th, it was widely understood that antifa was going to go door to door attacking white people. You, yourself, could tell me what they did instead.

*Nothing.*

In fact, Antifa’s main modus operandi seems to be doing *absolutely nothing.* You have already heard of every single major incident they’ve been involved in. Why? Because the mainstream media blows it up. Because conservatives need something to be afraid of. Because everyone lingered for months on this debate of whether it’s okay to punch a Nazi, because they have an *actual presence* in Berkeley, which is highly unusual and probably unique to the Bay Area. As someone who doesn’t live there, I can tell you: Antifa who?

Again, unless you’re conservative. Then the mainstream (because fox is mainstream) media uses them to scare the shit out of you.

Communism isn't classist. Marx explicitly said that rich people should be treated equally to the laborers, ie, expected to work, and not unfairly punished. Of course, most rich people don't want to be treated equally, and fund right wing death squads and the like to stop such things(see indonesia). It's not classist to fight back against that

>Antifa isn't waving around flags with Marx's face, they're waving around flags with the symbol of the USSR. You can support the "ideal, as of yet ever actually realized" version of communism, but if you support the actions of the USSR, something aint right. Supporting communism =/= waving about the flag of the USSR. 

The hammer and sickle is a generic communist symbol, it was around before the USSR. Same with black and red color schemes. In fact, most Antifa are anarchists/ancoms, which are quite against tankies(ussr supporters). Those that aren't, well, you can't judge a group by the outliers. All right wingers aren't bad just because of neo-nazis. 
Compared to right-wing terrorism, left-wing terrorism is a drop in the bucket. Its essentially a non-entity.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/26/alt-america-terrorism-rightwing-hate-crimes

Left wing terrorism that kills anyone is almost always ELF or ALF not anti-fascist groups.
White supremacists are in the White house. Right now. 

Compared to that issue, Antifa is nothing. 

I could go to WS or Neo Nazi websites and get a clear and stark reminder of what they would they would do if they got into power. I know their path. 

Antifa would just fade away if there were no Nazis or to deal with. They aren't going to round up and kill people. 

One of the two groups you are talking about is a bit more of a threat. 
I don't doubt for a moment that there are some real assholes on the left, but as for the substantial difference I would share what on my friends in Antifa said:  

> "If you don't go goose stepping around our towns and importing your mental poison we will largely hang around flirting with each other.  The moment you show up we will however put a boot in your ass."

Antifa is pretty much a philosophical knitting club and isn't making a road show of its violence in the manner that fascists of late are doing.  So yes, let's also talk about Antifa because sometimes they screw the pooch and they deserve to get called out on it but largely they are a response to aggression.
One is in the white house. Would you describe any members of the house or senate as part of the alt left?
Thanks for the reply. 

First I'd say, as I did in my OP, that if Antifa was, as their name implies, *just* anti-fascist, I wouldn't have nearly as much of an issue with them. But they've proven themselves to be anti-conservative (unless you think Ben and Milo are Nazis) and anti-ant-Communist (unless you think an ant-Communist rally specifically disavowing fascists was fascist). 

And much of Antifa *is* pro-Communist. *Actual* anti-fascism, as I said in the OP, isn't a bad thing, but Communism, which is a side ideology embraced and pushed by much of Antifa, *has* repeatedly demonstrated its ability to pose "a significant threat" to lots of people across the globe. 

>A deeper question is when should we organize against the far right.

An interesting aside I'm happy to discuss, and while I may indeed change my view on this subject I'd feel uncomfortable awarding a detla if I do just because it's so far from the point of this CMV. Unless you feel differently, of course. 

You really feel that the far-right is a dominant attitude in America? I mean, Trump *did* lose the popular vote. And progressivism has been running rampant in several western nations for nearly a decade now. It's often joked that a die-hard liberal 70 years ago would be downright conservative in modern times. The shift of most nations has been a neverending tide towards liberalism. Even the most hardcore conservative today isn't saying women shouldn't be allowed to vote, for example, only saying maybe there's reasons other than sexism why they're not well represented in STEM, or debating abortion policies. And while this progressive march results in countermovements from time to time, it's hard not to note that they're exceptions to the general rule that the left seems to be running the show. And this extends beyond politics; [the media](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-your-preferred-news-outlet-says-about-your-political-ideology-2014-10) is mostly left leaning, for instance. 
Dude,  Nazi's were the socialists.  It's in the name. They are the German socialist workers party. They weren't right wing, they were just a different brand of authoritarian socialists than the comunists
