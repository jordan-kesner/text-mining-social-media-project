Title: Corporate social media content and for an entire network

Post:
Good evening everyone.

I am contacting you because I would like to optimize the presence of my company on social networks.Note that I am alone in my department, that I manage communication in the broad sense.I work at the head of a network bringing together several independent professionals. This is regulated at the level of advertising. The only form of advertising authorized to date is LinkedIn Ads in B2B.

My two main targets: independent professionals who could join the network, the general public.My objectives on social media: recruit new members to the network to grow it, popularize legal themes to the general public.  


Presence on social networks:  
\- Each freelancer has a LinkedIn Company page and a Facebook Company page (+ Google profile) ;  
\- The head of the network which defends the common brand has a LinkedIn Company Page, a Facebook Company Page, a Twitter/X account, a YouTube channel and an Instagram account.Each year, I prepare and deploy an editorial schedule, linked to the different chestnut trees linked to the themes of the profession. I offer a new theme for B2C each week, alternating formats: video on Monday, infographic on Wednesday and article relay on Friday. These same publications are posted using a mass distribution tool on all social accounts (independent + Corporate).  


For B2B, I also offer publications on Tuesdays and Thursdays on Corporate accounts.What I have a problem with is that I decline posts on each platform. I don't have enough time because I'm alone and social media isn't the only thing I work on. BUT I realize that this can be improved. At the B2B level, LinkedIn does the job. I also capture business on other media (Instagram and Facebook). However, I sometimes hesitate to only stay on LinkedIn for this B2B business. The LinkedIn community (also including a little B2C) is growing well but the evolution is fading a little. I sometimes hesitate to publish things on my personal profile, to make myself an expert on a subject to get more engagement. But what if I leave the company? What are your opinions on this paragraph?  


For B2C, it is difficult for me to break into Facebook and Instagram. Communities are growing, but slowly. Moreover, I do not have the right to advertising and we know that the Meta algorithm is fond of money. From memory, only 7% of subscribers to a Facebook page see the content of a page they follow. The lack of budget/ability to budget clearly affects reach. On Instagram I play with hashtags but it doesn't increase reach/community much. I read that it was interesting to use Reels but I am not ready to film myself on camera for a subject whose fundamentals I do not understand.  


I could rely on freelancers who work with me because they have the expertise but not the time. In short, I don't see how I can increase awareness among the general public.  


Thanks for reading this far. I would appreciate your advice, because I feel like I'm reaching a point where I'm stagnating.

What is your niche? 
Depending on the industry, go for a content strategy. I am a video editor and sometimes get involved with the content part. Sometimes, multiple videos of same design styles, get very different number of views, one may have 2000 views while other may have 200k+ views. So, a content strategy helps a lot in boosting.
