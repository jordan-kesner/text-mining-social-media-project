Title: CMV: In order to deal effectively with this new wave of white supremacy, we should imitate MLK's legacy and drop the "Punch a Nazi" rhetoric

Post:
Saw some other posts making a similar point but nobody bringing up MLK.

MLK's legacy has lasted so long because he approached racism and prejudice with love, compassion, and nonviolent defiance.  Much of it was calculated, sure, but no less effective and real.

If we are to stand strong in the face of a new wave of white nationalism (which at the moment still seems like a fringe of radicalized young men and not yet a political norm hopefully) I think the far better path to engage them would be MLK's attitude and legacy - this doesn't mean bowing down to them, of course, or pretending like what they're saying has any value.  It means when you show up to protest, you sing, you stay positive, you focus on community and compassion rather than the negativity of the other side.

We're sitting now in the privileged position of having benefited from MLK's leadership and the civil rights movement (and hundreds of other leaders) so now the anti-white supremacists are the norm and expected - but that shouldn't let us get cocky, or make us get violent.  MLK understood that the violence of his opponents would ultimately be their undoing - and to fight them back would only take a life for a life, and not add to the movement at all.  It would only embolden the other side (and he was right.)

This is why the bravado and chest bumping "Punch a Nazi" rhetoric bothers me - it feels good in the moment, but ultimately pointless.  It's just chest thumping.  It's not defeating their ideology, it's only threatening the neo-Nazis physically (which they want and feed off).  These guys went to Charlottesville to pick a fight, and they got it - the violence is still on them, but we *can not* engage them physically in the future.  Footage before the car crash of the march was really violent, and partially infuriating to me - counter protestors pushing into the neo-Nazis with big boards saying "No fascists", etc.  What's the point if they physically over came them?  You can't crush hatred by gaining a few bit of pavement, or throwing a punch at a Nazi.  You can't, and you'll only embolden the little trolls looking for a fight.

Ultimately our superior worldview (and it is superior) is partially rooted in the idea that violence is bad.  For the white people that had a hard time during the civil rights era, this was at least a brilliant connecting thought between the two cultures - maybe you can't understand your racism yet, but maybe you can see your desire for violence is wrong.  MLK knew this and understood it.  To say "We punch Nazis" is unfortunately no different than "We punch black people" in the eyes of a white supremacist - stripped of their sides and who's 'right' and 'wrong', they're both promises of violence and a threat.

I just think we should surround their little marches with locked arms, signs based on peace and love and all that good stuff, and seriously keep from engaging with them.  They're real live internet trolls in the flesh - borrowing from the KKK, the Nazis, they just picked every possible imagery they could to piss decent people off and they showed up looking for a race war.

Thoughts?

**UPDATE: Well sorry to be stubborn but nobody's really changed my view yet - the effectiveness of non-violence vs. violence - and it seems like the main points of disagreement are mainly over the type of threat these neo-Nazis pose.  Is violence okay if it's preventing a future Nazi Germany, etc?  This is hard to debate (to me) because I have to accept many assumptions I reject (I think we're far from becoming Nazi Germany, and that these neo-Nazis represent little more than a rogue extremists white nationalist movement).  Whether or not violence is okay against the next Hitler feels like a separate debate to me and I'm actually surprised how many people actually seriously believe these white supremacists have any shot of changing America into Nazi Germany...but again, that feels like a separate debate.**

**UPDATE 2: Today's events in Boston sort of strengthen my position.  Beside the fact that the white supremacist / "Free speech" protestors were outnumber 10 to 1, they were also given distance and were not engaged with physically and today we're all celebrating how meaningless their march looked.  If they had been attacked I think it would've only have emboldened their cause and made the counter protestors look bad.**

I think you're misunderstanding King's legacy, from the cherry-picked point of view of white America looking back. He said "hate does not drive out hate," but he also said “freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed." He deliberately held marches in places he knew would result in violence, and even placed children on the front lines because he knew the image of children being beaten would provoke a greater sympathy than the image of grown men being beaten. 

Most Americans thought MLK was being too aggressive, and he received much of the same sort of criticism at the time that's leveled at BLM and Antifa today. 

In his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, King wrote:
>I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"

MLK acknowledged (in the same letter) that violent protest was regrettable, but he also placed all blame for it squarely on the shoulders of those who refused to acknowledge or negotiate with peaceful protest. People have been peacefully protesting in this country for years, yet institutions and bigots have only doubled down. If Nazis don't want to be punched in the face, they have to be willing to negotiate; since they're unwilling to negotiate, they shouldn't be shocked or offended by more forceful means of resistance. 
>t's not defeating their ideology, it's only threatening the neo-Nazis physically (which they want and feed off).

Disagree on several counts.

Firstly, the psychology of fascism is a kind of masculinity cult, centred around the worship of power and the symbols of it. It absolutely matters to them how powerful they feel. 

Secondly, I would encourage you to look up the history and methods of the Klu Klux Klan and how they've historically  perpetrated their campaign of terror. They start with the violence, the public lynchings and so on, but the point of the violence is so that you can use the *symbol* of the violence to keep black people in line. You can point at the noose and say "this is what we do to you".

So when the klan march through a town, even if it's a "peaceful" march, it's still a threat of violence. The fact that they CAN walk through going "look how bad we can fuck you up" and no one stops them, is a display that it's *their* town. Time to leave, n*ggers.

You're thinking in terms of "well, we're not at the Man in the High Castle/Wolfenstein America point yet where nazism is accepted and American soldiers are wearing red armbands and shovelling 6 million into the gas chambers, and I don't see how we get there so they aren't a real threat" but the *immediate* threat of white supremism is more small scale, White supremacy in the US post slavery has historically been a force which strikes with small targeted acts of terror against specific communities. They don't need to have nationwide, global domination type power and ambition to be a terrorist threat, right now.

Third, what white supremacists actually want long term is political legitimacy. If they are allowed to march peacefully and "reasonably" that allows them to perpetuate the narrative that this is some kind of legitimate movement, white America on the march type thing. If everywhere they go is mayhem they just look like thugs.


See, the battle of Lewishham, London 1977

>The most widely accepted narrative of the violence suggests that the NF chose to march through Lewisham, with its sizeable black community, to provoke a strong reaction.
Yet another factor was also in play, one that has been largely forgotten since: the NF had targeted Lewisham because they knew they would be welcomed by many residents.
“The dialogue which gets overlooked, because it is less palatable, is that there was considerable support for the NF,” said John Price, head of history at Goldsmiths University, which stands metres from where the day’s opening clashes took place.
[...]
But the battle of Lewisham would turn into a disaster for the far right. Although its boot boy element would glorify the violence as a great day out, the NF’s ambition to become a political force began to ebb away even as the broken bottles were being swept from Lewisham’s streets.
For a start, the NF had found themselves vastly outnumbered on a patch they thought was their own – at least 4,000 counter-protesters had turned up. Second,the NF were also stopped from marching as they had intended. They were separated from the counter-demonstrators and then marched through empty side-streets by hundreds of police before being led on to waiting trains – the first time that had happened to the NF, a development that challenged its self-identity as a potent street movement.
In a similar way that the 1936 battle of Cable Street, four miles north of New Cross Road, had dealt a definitive blow to the aspirations of Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists, the battle of Lewisham helped frame the NF as unpopular, thuggish and simultaneously feeble.
White and black youths, and local anti-racist groups among others forced the NF to abandon its march in a similar manner to how the ranks of Mosley’s group were turned away by London Jews and Irish labourers. Despite their capacity to generate significant support as well as fear, the two London defeats, 40 years apart, helped ensure that the message of the two extremist movements would never be translated into political potency.
“The official literature of the NF talks a lot about how Lewisham was very damaging to them. They turned up with what they thought was a force but were hugely outnumbered, then they were prevented from marching through Lewisham – plus press coverage did not paint them as victims but painted them as guilty as anybody else. They never really maintained their hold on the area,” said Price.

This goes back to point 1 and how fascism is a kind of inherently violent masculinity cult. One weakness of this is it means they can't really play the "noble victim" role effectively like genuine rights movements can. They most anyone can say to defend them is the Trump "both sides are bad" thing, which I disagree with obviously, but hey, at least it acknowledges they're thugs. 


>They're real live internet trolls in the flesh -

No they're not. The thing that defines an internet troll is his  non-presence. Despite his taunts his just some words on a screen, hes not actually a navy seal and can't actually fuck your mother or whatever- so you ignore him. When it's actually an armed mob in front of you, it's not the same situation.

>I just think we should surround their little marches with locked arms

This local church groups tried to do this in Charlottesville.

>Rebekah Menning

I stood with a group of interfaith clergy and other people of faith in a nonviolent direct action meant to keep the white nationalists from entering the park to their hate rally. We had far fewer people holding the line than we had hoped for, and frankly, it wasn’t enough. No police officers in sight (that I could see from where I stood), and we were prepared to be beaten to a bloody pulp to show that while the state permitted white nationalists to rally in hate, in the many names of God, we did not. But we didn’t have to because the anarchists and anti-fascists got to them before they could get to us. I’ve never felt more grateful and more ashamed at the same time. The antifa were like angels to me in that moment.


Did you know that at no point in Nazi Germany were the actions they took that exterminated Jews illegal?  Did you know that actions stopping extermination were often punished by death?

Many people look at the First Amendment in the US as something sacred, and I'm inclined to think it's sacred as well.  However, the 1st Amendment applies only to the *government* stopping free speech.

What I want you to understand here is that if Nazi Germany was to be stopped, at some point someone would have had to take action, and violently stop Nazis.  Everything Nazis did were legal in their country.  In order to have stopped Nazis, illegal action, action silencing the hateful, would have had to have been taken.  If the US -- god forbid-- becomes a fascist state, persecution will likely happen in a legal manner.  Illegal action will need to be taken to stop it.

And here's the thing.  You can look and what I'm talking about and think that the only way the government would persecute and subjugate its own people would be in some sci-fi future.  But the thing is that slavery existed for more time in our country's history than not.  It was longer between the end of the Civil War and the end of segregation than between segregation and today. 

Do you oppose the illegal acts of civil disobedience committed by Civil Rights leaders in the 50s and 60s?  Because let's not forget, much of what they did was illegal.  Would you oppose a man in 1937 Germany killing Nazis?  Don't forget, he couldn't have known what Nazism would have led to.  Would you oppose a man killing Josef Stalin in 1950?  He couldn't have known the horrors of Stalinist Russia.

The basic premise of what you've said is the understanding that violence is a bad way to conduct one's self in society.  I get that.  Usually you're right.  But at some point it *has* to become justified.  I'm sure you'd agree that war against the Nazis was justified.  But at some point *before* war it had to be justified as well.  At some point it *had* to have been justified to attack Nazis.  If you could have stopped the Nazis in the 30s through violence, there is no doubt that would have been justified.

I guess I'm not even asking you to agree with me that what happened in Virginia last weekend warranted violence.  I would just be happy if you were to agree with me that at some point it would be morally justified to commit acts of violence against those that would commit much more heinous acts of violence against others, without justification, especially on a large scale.

Please let me know if I'm seriously rambling or off base.
MLK’s supposed “moderation” and “win them over with love” strategy is the biggest misconception. He was never about moderation. See this quote: http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/060.html. He did like the moral upper hand, but you’ve got to be living in a pretty twisted world to give any kind of moral equivalience to Nazis. This is run-of-the-mill respectability politics and it doesn’t work. You cannot expect an oppressed people to “behave” a certain way before you “allow” them to have their god-given rights and I do believe I have a god-given right to not have my existence threatened by people who think I’m sub-human. 

MLK’s go-to strategy was political pressure and he had no qualms about doing it top-down. Instead of “changing the hearts of minds of middle america”, he simply pressured congress to shove the civil rights act and desegregation down people’s throat. The fact that some people still can’t accept it is not black people’s problem. 

Now if Nazi’s come to my town to threaten my existence. I’m punching them. 
What wave of white supremacy? White supremacist groups have been on a steady downward trend for years. Neo Nazi groups in particular have literally halved since 2006 to the current date. Don't mistake media coverage of an event for an increase in the frequency of an event.
For what it's worth, Malcolm X is associated with rifles but MLK and his kin were strapped.  There were guns under almost every pillow in his house.  He wasn't stupid.  They marched for rights and they protested the best way they could, but they were still very much prepared to defend themselves.  MLK was a radical socialist by the end of his life (probably before, but it really came out then).
MLK was trying to convince a large majority of Americans that the people he was marching with were equal to other Americans. He won that fight when his opponents degraded themselves by unleashing attack dogs and knocking children over with fire hoses.

Antifa however, need not convince anyone that they are better than Neo-Nazis. Most people already hate them. Maybe some people will say Antifa are just as bad as Nazis. They are wrong, but what's the harm if they think that? Antifa aren't trying to win rights for themselves or gain other people's respect. That want to make it socially unacceptable to be a Nazi in public

There are certain rules in society that are unspoken, that we do not need to have a conversation about. Once, Ronald Reagan was criticized for having dinner guests who were Holocaust deniers. Yes, but whenever they bring up the holocaust I always tell them that it did happen, he said. But the problem was that he was having that conversation at all. Similarly, we should live in a society where we don't have to convince people that shouting nigger, carrying torches, and giving seig heils is wrong. It should be taken for granted that it's wrong. You can't reason with sociopaths.

As long as it's just limited to punching, I'm OK with it as a form of civil disobedience. I don't see how it harms anyone except the Nazi and the person throwing the punch. It gets media attention, and the message that gets out is that people really hate nazis.
MLK's method really only worked because the alternative WAS a violent angry group, the black panthers and malcolm X. you present 2 choices to people. peaceful civil rights or open revolt with guns and violence. which do you think people would choose.

playing kumbaya with violent, racist, and now murdering assholes is just foolish. the core of the whole white nationalists is fear. they're afraid they'll be screwed when they become the minority. well present them 2 options. one where their fear is realized and you have violent people who want to oppress them, and another side where they can come out and be on the same level as everyone, have the same rights as everyone.

you need to understand who you're up against. ghandi, and MLK were up against governments, first world governments that weren't dictatorships. if they turned violent against those peaceful methods it looks horrible for them. for white nationalists, them getting violent doesn't matter to them. you can't always fight violence with peace. sometimes you have to fight it with violence, maybe just the threat of violence instead of actual violence, but still.
Is there really a "new wave" though? Compared to 50 years ago I feel the racial divide has become more narrow but the constant barrage of news pushing an agenda of hate makes the masses feel there is really a divide. 

Think about this, when you go along your normal day how much racism do you really see? Among the people you work with, have friendships with, etc. 

Personally I don't see it. Now is that to say racism doesn't exist? No. Racism exists and there will always be racist people but the problem is only being exasperated by the media. (IMHO) 
The white ethno-nationalism and the various groups like Antifa are at the purest part of their existence, reactionary. Neonazis are afraid of the anti-white rhetoric(Die Whites Die) and antifa are afraid of that rhetoric meaning extension to an ethnostate.

It's all fear. There are no Nazis or Communists protesting whose goals are the extermination of X people. There are only people that fear for some part of their individual identity, race, culture, etc. 

The Western world has never been a more tolerant and equal place than it is now. We are less divided than we have ever been, and that scares the men and women in high places more than anything ever could.

> I just think we should surround their little marches with locked arms

This creates the "us vs them" narrative that created their reactionary movement in the first place. A group created to fight is not going to change their mind by being fought.

> They're real live internet trolls in the flesh - borrowing from the KKK, the Nazis, they just picked every possible imagery they could to piss decent people off

They do it because it is what has been done to them. Antifa is the same, BLM is the same, radical islamic terror is the same. The people in these groups are being told that they are going to be destroyed, and the people that gain from the infighting are the ones pointing the finger.

If you want to stop Neo-nazis, change your protests to fight racism against everyone, whites included.

Change your rhetoric from "It's us vs **them**, **they** deserve to be destroyed, **they** cannot experience adversity" to what MLK said "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."

> they showed up looking for a race war.

Nazi aren't born, they're made. And antifa is gathering support for them.
