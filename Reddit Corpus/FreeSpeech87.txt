Title: Big tech’s reaction to the H. Biden story is the most the blatantly censorious thing I’ve ever seen. I don’t care that they are private companies, censorship is ALWAYS wrong.

That is all.

Then dont use the platform of any tech company you find objectionable. The proper way to express your dissatisfaction is boycott. That is the libertarian answer.
Someone didn't see the CCP censoring the Presidential debates lol. Private companies can censor whatever they want according to libertarianism.
Censoring the censorship of private companies is censorship. If you want to control Twitter's platform that makes you an authoritarian.
So if you owned a coffee shop and someone was in there yelling about a bunch of stupid shit, you wouldn't tell them to leave?
So tired of this stupid argument.

Did you know that you can be against censorship by private companies on principle?

Acts of censorship don’t have to violate the 1st amendment for me to find them totally disgusting.  

There is a massive attempt right now to stop the ability to more freely spread information and you just stick your head in the sand because it’s politically convenient.  

If you actually believe in free speech, like libertarians do, you’d protest when even private companies are egregiously fucking with free speech as well.
Fuck Trump and you.  

Literally ZERO humility or self-awareness with any of you.  

And damn, you weirdos sure are working overtime on Reddit to keep this story hidden.
