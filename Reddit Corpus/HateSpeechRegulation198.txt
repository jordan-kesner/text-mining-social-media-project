Speech that incites or is intended to cause [imminent lawless action](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imminent_lawless_action) is not constitutionally protected and is not considered free speech. If anybody was wondering if this was a free speech issue. 
Does this mean NYPD will have full access to the FB data of anyone in NYC, or will they have to make a ton of spam accounts and add everyone as a friend on those?
Perhaps im a bit altruistic, but in todays atmosphere, i think citizens have been doing their own "snitching" when something illegal has been forecasted in their social circles.  It seems like a giant waste of money to hire cops to browse the internet all day...
I'm sorry, but that's a terribly photoshopped hat sitting on a terribly photoshopped stack of files .  The gun and handcuffs are horribly staged for the "clutter" of an internet detective.  
I know for a fact that Crime Analysts currently do use social media to track down information about criminals. People (especially criminals) are dumb, and brag about their exploits. This is only a natural extension of that. 
The way to stop this is to have a "brag about or plan crimes on social media sites" day. This will fuck up the legal process and their ability to actually track leads. It's basically a weird form of protest on the internet.
Your tax dollars at work. At least it will winnow out a few of the incredibly stupid jerks who think that ripping off folks is so cool that they advertise it.
In the criminal justice system, police officers often rely on leads and tips from citizens to detect and prevent crime from taking place. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who troll Facebook and Twitter are members of an elite squad known as the pre-crimes unit. These are their stories." DUN DUN!
