I’m not sure if Reddit counts as social media, but deleting instagram and forgetting about Snapchat has been the most liberating thing
I disabled Facebook and Instagram. I'd always compare my life to other people's. And they aren't showing the bad shit. They share their good. Meanwhile, I'd only share bad shit because if good things were happening, I was enjoying it too much to post about it.

I'm honestly much happier. 
I stopped using Twitter and it’s been really nice,I mean, I only want to kill myself a little less now.
