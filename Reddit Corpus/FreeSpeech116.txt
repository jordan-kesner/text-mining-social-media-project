Who cares? He is literally running the Internet freedom foundation and working to ensure free speech.  That includes speech you don't like.

and being promoted by Elmo.  Always worry about the ulterior motives.  Sure, free speech is great, but is your end goal just to scrap any misinformation/disinformation/botting guardrails to make right wing propaganda accessible?

I'm no fan of  disingenuously slapping mis/disinformation labels on inconvenient truths but I'm not an child who thinks misinformation/disinformation doesn't exist or isn't damaging.
