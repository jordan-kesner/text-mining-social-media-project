Title: Social Media Management for friends. Advice pls?

Post:
I know that is kinda broad in scope. But I have two friends who are into Social Media. I'd like to help them expand and monetize their online profiles. My background is in web development, online marketing and business. I create content for Social Media but I'm not an influencer or anything like that.  


Friend 1: A mum, fashionista, vegan and gym-goer with over 100k followers on TikTok alone. She juggles raising kids, gym and social media all while holding down a full-time job. Many mothers will relate.   


Her goals are to monetize her channel and to help pay the rent. Her biggest issue is the hate and vile comments she gets by a small minority of her audience. This has caused her to experience mental health and body-shame issues even though she has a natural and beautiful image.

  
Friend 2: A dating advice guy, who provides - women mostly - with dating advice from a male-perspective. He has around 30K TikTok followers and gets lots of engagement.  


His channel is growing rapidly and he appeals to a cross-segment of women from teenage girls, right up to middle-aged women. His biggest issue is monetizing his channel and supporting himself while making this his full-time gig.  


I'd like to know...  


1. Which social monitoring tool should i use to monitor the analytics of these accounts. I have data studio and conversion tracking experience so i don't mind rolling my own. However a turnkey solution would be great also. I'm familiar with SparkToro but neither account is in the SparkToro database.  

2. I don't have a whole lot of time to invest, i make my living elsewhere. How can i earn these influencers product promotion deals without spending hours on tools like [influence.co](https://influence.co) submitting proposal after proposal or worse - cold calling companies.  

3. How can i best spend my limited time with these accounts? Should i approach a talent agency? Besides planning, content scheduling and setting goals. What approach would you take?

Your friends are lucky to have you helping them out. Here's my take on your questions:

1. **Social media monitoring tools**: Hootsuite and Sprout Social are popular choices that offer analytics and scheduling. Both integrate with various platforms, so you can track performance across channels.
2. **Monetization**: For Friend 1, consider connecting her with brands that align with her values (e.g., vegan, eco-friendly, or mom-focused companies) for sponsored posts. For Friend 2, he could explore affiliate marketing for dating-related products or even create his own digital products (eBooks, courses).
3. **Maximizing your time**: Instead of cold calling, use your network to connect with relevant brands or companies. If you're open to partnering with a talent agency, it could save time and help negotiate deals. Additionally, focus on producing high-quality content and engaging with the audience to foster a strong community.

Remember, consistency and authenticity are key to success on social media. Best of luck to you and your friends!

**TL;DR:** Use social media analytics tools like Hootsuite or Sprout Social, consider affiliate marketing, and focus on content quality and audience engagement.
