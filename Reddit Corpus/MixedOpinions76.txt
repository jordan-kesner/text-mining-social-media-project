Title: CMV: Hate speech is subjective and therefore cannot be consistently separated from free speech and will never have sound legal footing

Post:
I've been thinking a lot about the fine line between hate speech and free speech. I have come to the conclusion that while I personally think that certain speech is "hateful" and should never be spoken in public forums, I don't think that there is anything objectively different about it from other specific subjects and forms of speech.

I'll demonstrate with an example to make my point clearer: I think that Nazi organizations should be outlawed. Being Jewish myself I have a personal objection to the beliefs of the Nazi. But this is completely subjective, one might say that there is a logical reason to outlaw Nazi organizations because Nazi ideology advocates harming certain populations but that can apply to other forms of speech.

For example: Can one not say that pro-life organizations advocate the killing of babies? Wouldn't that cause pro-life rallies to be considered hate speech?

The natural next step I saw in how to solve this issue legally is to say we allow certain types of speech but others. That can be a viable solutions depending on how your government works but this relies on subjective opinion and can change as public officials change.

This strange overlap between free speech and hate speech is why I think they hate speech could never have a consistent legal definition.

I'm not saying I'd be in support of hate speech laws (I am generally very favorable to free speech in a legal context), but the best argument I've seen made in favor of hate speech laws is that they are the collective equivalent of slander/libel against an individual. I can't just legally go around telling people that my neighbor is a rapist. In some legal jurisdictions, you also can't go around telling people Group X are a bunch of rapists.
>For example: Can one not say that pro-life organizations advocate the killing of babies? Wouldn't that cause pro-life rallies to be considered hate speech?

Do you have another example that isn't also a hot button topic?
Your initial premise is flawed, when you say you've been thinking about "the line between hate speech and free speech"

There's no line, hate speech is a subcategory of free speech. That's like saying you're looking for the line between carrots and food. 

This is why the term "hate speech" is so insidious, perhaps downright evil, and why I despise it so much. It makes it sound like it's another broad, distinct speech category. Let's call hateful speech "hateful speech," lowercase. You wouldn't define the term Sports Speech to describe anyone talking about sports, or Work Speech to refer to speech involving employment. The only people who seem to call anything "Hate Speech" are people who have been deceived by this lie that it's somehow separate from "free speech."

Hate Speech, Sports Speech, Mumbling Speech, and Work Speech are all nonsense categories that aren't actually proper nouns, and most importantly - none are in any way separate or distinct from Free Speech.

What you seem to be referring to is the radical left "social justice" use of the term "hate speech". You have to realize that one of the tactics of the radical left (as opposed to liberal left), is to just redefine words and phrases to acquire the *connotations* of the old meanings but use it to justify their ideology and make it seem you support nasty things if you disagree.

For example, they define speech as violence, so that they can refer to the violence of their opponents. They define "safe", as in safe spaces, as in spaces where their ideology is protected so that when people disagree then they can claim they feel "unsafe" around these opposing views. 

Or they redefine "equality" to mean something akin to "statistical parity". Equality means that *every individual* is equal to every other individual, regardless of their traits such as race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, etc. And "equal" here means that they will not be judged based on those traits, but rather by their individual merits relevant to the circumstances (performance on tests, evidence of crimes, etc.). The "social justice" redefinition isn't about all people, or about judging them, but about averages of groups and a presumed entitlement that these averages must come out equal or proportional to raw population, under the belief that differences in outcome *is* an unfair bias against people in the lower average group.

They do the reverse too in order to deflect criticism of their views. Racism, sexism, and bigotry have well defined meanings with respect to moral principles and reasoning errors (specifically the [fallacy of division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_division)) whereby people take a stereotype (real or perceived) of a group of people based on a trait (e.g., race, skin color, gender, ethnicity) and apply it to all individuals. That's not reasonable nor fair to do, and creates injustice against individuals by association simply because they share a trait. But this movement simply redefines bigotry to be a "bias + power", which has nothing to do with the moral or reasoning failure, and then apply power using the fallacy of division itself. That is, an individual may have no power, but if their gender or skin color has (real or perceived) power *on average* greater than some other group defined by trait (men vs women, white vs black, etc.), then that *individual* has power because the group they "belong to" does. Hence they allow themselves to be racist and sexist as long as they are attacking people who have traits that coincide with the majority or (real or perceived) greater power *on average*. E.g., it's ok to be biased against *individuals* who are white and/or male simply for being white and for being males, because white people *on average* have more power that other skin colors, and men have more power on average than women. (They also limit this fallacious reasoning only to "power" because it's the same reasoning classical racists use to justify hatred, e.g., if *crime* is higher on average with black people they'd use that to justify hating individuals who are black, which is just as wrong.)

So when it comes to "hate speech", they often refer to it as any speech that opposes their views, particularly ones that discuss the very things I mention above. Your description of pro-choice/life issue falls into that category.

I might be accused of "hate speech" because I am contradicting them on the topics of race, gender, etc., and since they believe what they are doing is for a goal of giving more power to marginalized trait groups (as opposed to equality of all individuals regardless of traits), they see opposition as being about hating people with those traits (or rather, of hating the *group* of people with those traits).

That, of course, is absolutely irrational and destructive. (The identity group-based "social justice" approach has resulted in dystopian societies of oppression, genocide, massive injustice, and the death and suffering of tens of millions of people.)

In that context, the social justice version of "hate speech" is meaningless and self-serving. But, they have nicked the term from something more legitimate, which is the incitement of violence against people based on their traits.

Put another way, if I were to threaten to beat you up or kill you directly, I think you'd agree that this is both illegal and *should be* illegal. It is a limitation on my "free speech". The same is true if I tell another person to beat you up or kill you. I would then be guilty for the threat, and if they carried it out, I would be guilty of that violence and murder too. You can't escape a murder charge by hiring somebody to do it for you instead of doing it yourself. That makes sense.

Similarly, if I were to threaten you by telling other people to harm you -- not by name, but by your traits -- that should also be illegal. If I tell them to kill all people with a username with "Beard" in it, that would include you. Not only would you feel scared for your life, assuming it is a threat that has reasonable chance of actually being carried out, but if other people carried out my wishes then I get to have you harmed or killed and get away with it. 

*Real* hate speech laws are generally target at that case, such as [Section 318 to 320 of the Canadian Criminal Code](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-73.html#docCont). Section 318 makes it illegal to advocate or promote genocide of an identifiable group, which means "any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or mental or physical disability."

Section 319(1) outlaws inciting hatred against an identifiable group where it is likely to result in a breach of the peace, i.e., violence. Section 319(2) moves a bit toward the grey zone of free speech, as it outlaws *willfully* promoting hatred against an identifiable group, which sounds like to could be misused. But, it allows defences under 319(3) that include (a) establishing that the statements are true, (b) in good faith attempted to describe a religious belief (This is problematic!), (c) if the person believed it had public value to discuss and believed them to be true, and (d) was actually trying to point out hate speech material in order to have it removed.

Section 320 allows a judge to seize materials that violate the above sections, referred to as "hate propaganda".

I think 319(2) this toes the line of your concerns. What is clear is that you can discuss concerns reasonably, even if your views are racist, sexist, or whatever, so long as you are putting it in context of public interests or in discussions about what you believe. If you are simply out screaming about Jews, Muslims, blacks, whites, men, women, in a way that is malicious toward the identifiable group rather than an intellectual discussion *about* such groups, that's the problem cases. 

So, while imperfect in 319(2), you can see 318 and 319(1), and 320, all seem reasonably well defined. That isn't to say that somebody can't then argue about what is *reasonable*, or how one determines what is "likely" with respect to breaching the peace, but that's how common law generally deals with all legal boundaries; it requires effort at objective reasoning. If you have to create contrived circumstances then a lawyer or judge will generally recognize that you are contriving an answer rather than being honest. For example, if you want to claim the religious exception of 319(2), you probably need some evidence of the religious doctrines in question and evidence that you have been a follower of that religion for some time.

What I see in your post appears to be getting along the lines of somewhat common attempts to parse things into clear categories. That is generally impossible with any law, of course. The difference between manslaughter, second degree murder, first degree murder, and self-defense certainly have clear cases for each, but there will always be fuzzy boundaries where the intent, belief, and effort are all factors of judgment for a judge and jury.

That is why they are called *judges*. If a simple parsing algorithm could easily divide them into clear categories, we wouldn't need anybody to judge things. However, making judgments doesn't mean the same as *subjectivity*. Rather, the judgment is supposed to be based on an objective measure of the *probability* that something violates a particular law or the intent of the law. There's fuzziness all around in terms of imperfect information, imperfect definition, imperfect coverage of all cases under legislation, imperfect wording. That is what judging is all about.

This is why, for example, you often get dissenting opinions in appellate courts and supreme courts with multiple judges. Not all judges even come to the same conclusions about the events or the boundaries of the laws.

*Subjectivity* means that there *can't* be an objective measure, no matter how precisely we define the law or have perfect information. The best ice cream flavour is subjective. You could define an objective "best", but people would still individually have different preferences so it provides no value.

The same isn't true of hate speech. You *can* define it such that perfect knowledge could result in everybody reaching the same conclusion. They may not all agree it *should* be hate speech, but that's different.

If by "hate speech" you mean people's *preferences* about speech, then yes it is like "best" ice cream. But that is different from saying you can't create a sound legal footing for it. 

I would just say that you aren't going far enough. Even if you could objectively define hate speech, it still shouldn't be illegal. All speech should be legal. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Didn't everyone used to support freedom of speech? It was like the one thing that wasn't controversial.
First I have to point out that hate speech does in fact have a sound legal footing as it is currently codified in actual law

> I think that Nazi organizations should be outlawed. Being Jewish myself I have a personal objection to the beliefs of the Nazi. But this is completely subjective

Moral positions such as these are not "completely subjective" because many, many people agree with your "personal objection" to Nazi ideology.

>  Can one not say that pro-life organizations advocate the killing of babies? Wouldn't that cause pro-life rallies to be considered hate speech?

People who support abortion rights are not a class of person protected from hate speech against that class, so no

> This strange overlap between free speech and hate speech is why I think they hate speech could never have a consistent legal definition.

It does have a consistent legal definition, however I think what you mean here is that it is not 100% logically rigorous? If so, that's perfectly okay. Human affairs are not easily submitted to logical rigor. This is why we don't have computers who take in the law as input and render verdicts as output. We have a judicial system made up of human beings ("judges" and "juries") who decide on a case-by-case basis
Hate speech IS subjective, and that virtually guarantees that there will be a strong push to give it legal footing by any faction that wants to shut people up.  

This is why the American left is the biggest threat too American free speech. 

They have succeeded in giving a separate criminality to hate crimes, once the 'hate' stigma is also applied to speech, it's a small step from there to criminalizing hate speech and " goodbye first amendment".
Consider other kinds of speech that are banned in healthy democracies: child pornography, libel, incitement to violence, false advertising, spam. Aren't these all subjective too? Certainly there are problems in the corner cases, but do you think those problems are so bad that we should just legalize those things altogether? If not, how is hate speech different?

Lots of legal questions - maybe all of them - involve subjective decisions. That's why laws are interpreted by judges, in courtrooms with lawyers arguing both sides, instead of by purely objective computer algorithms. If you want to undo every law that can't be enforced by a computer, you're not going to have much left.


>For example: Can one not say that pro-life organizations advocate the killing of babies? Wouldn't that cause pro-life rallies to be considered hate speech?

I assume you mean pro-choice. Are fetuses a persecuted minority? Do these activists spread prejudice against fetuses? Does the fetus community live in fear and oppression because people are allowed to use anti-fetal slurs in public and remind them they're powerless? Does this create division and make fully born humans suspicious of their fetus neighbors or vice versa? Some people might answer yes to some of those questions but not all. It's even less common that laws would recognize fetushood as a minority status like race or sexual orientation. So, it probably wouldn't follow that pro-choice groups are hate groups. 
Why do you think we have courts? We have sound legal definitions for all sorts of crimes, but the accused still get to go to court and argue why their actions don't fit the definition of a crime. I think you have a really strange idea of what 'sound legal footing' is. We have to argue it out in front of a jury and a judge in order to determine what counts as hate speech, or libel, or even murder. 

So the definition of hate speech is typically 'speech with the intent of inciting violence against a person or class of people.' It's actually legal to do this in the US, and illegal in most parts of Europe. Juuuuuust so you know.
