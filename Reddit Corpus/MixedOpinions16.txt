Title: CMV: Free Speech should be absolute.

Post:
Free speech is one of the most important freedoms. It allows someone to hold and express any opinion and prevents the state from encroaching on people thoughts and opinions. Moreover, it is a freedom that when used effects no one except those who listen.   

However, people seem happy for it to be limited by illegalising hate speech which only encourages such opinions and libel which makes people fear and not be able to talk about news and important issues for fear of a lawsuit. Moreover, why is it the job of the state to say what may and may not be said when such limitations are better dealt with via social consequences, id est, if you get a swastika tattoo on your forehead everyone will stop being your friend except other people who hold that opinion. Allowing the state to do such things only paves the way for tyrrany and liberal interpretations of what speech is allowed or what speech does encourage violence.   

TL:DR, I suppose, is that the state has no job in limiting speech.       


PS: When I say absolute, I mean it (harassment et cetera included).

What about dangerous speech? Such as screaming fire or bomb in a crowded space, it can easily invoke a panic that leads to death or injury.
First fault in your argument:
"Moreover, why is it the job of the state to say what may and may not be said when such limitations are better dealt with via social consequences, id est, if you get a swastika tattoo on your forehead everyone will stop being your friend except other people who hold that opinion."

Why is it the state's job to determine which physical contact is or isn't appropriate. If I kill or rape someone, people will stop wanting to be my friends and not interact with me anymore. Except those who are cool with murder and rape.
What about dangerous speech? (The biggest example being creating a panic in a public area, used elsewhere in the thread.)

What about distributing child porn? Should this be a protected form of speech?

What about inciting violence? Such as speaking at a rally and telling everyone to "fuck up the next police officer you see?"

What about revealing personal information? Say I'm a politician and I don't like what X journalist is writing about me, so I complain about them in my next public appearance, by dropping their name and home address?

What about statements of illegal intent? "I'm going to perform <X act of violence> at <this time> and <this place>?" Should they be ignored?

What about state secrets?

What about violating an NDA?
Totally absolute? People should be allowed to shout "FIRE" in a crowded theater? People should be able to slander others? No libel?

would you be in favor of someone shouting we should kill bob smith at 12 main street, springfield Illinois at 2:09 pm? I think direct threats of violence should be banned.

Does that mean the right to interrupt others, e.g. in a class?

What about cheating? Should students be able to use free speech to share answers during exams?

> PS: When I say absolute, I mean it (harassment et cetera included). 

Do you mean that *only* in relation to state prohibition, or do you include non-state entities? Should e.g. the media have to allow all speech in its publications?

So, if I want some lads to turn up at your place of work, and your place of residence, and blast ["music"](https://youtu.be/yQBE2XxXjL0?t=45) as loud as we possibly can, and otherwise be physically unobstructive...?

Something tells me you're going to respond with "well I just wouldn't go there," but I'm eager for you to prove me wrong.
