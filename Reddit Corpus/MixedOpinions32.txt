Title: CMV: Canada is a freer country than the United States.

Post:
I think that in terms of liberty of its citizens, Canada is overall significantly freer than the United States.

In particular, I think that Canada is much freer in terms of criminal law, police practices, and the carceral state.  For a few specific examples: marijuana is legal; criminal sentences are much shorter on average; there is no death penalty; conditions of confinement are much more humane; police brutality is much less frequent, and more frequently punished.

I think Canada is substantially freer in terms of democratic participation.  Canada has a much more robust right to vote, with voting an absolute right for all Canadian citizens over 18, no exceptions.  Canada does have somewhat more curtailed free speech laws than the US, with a prosecutable hate speech law for specifically advocating genocide against a defined group.  But political debates in Canada are robust and free.

I think Canada is about on par with the US in terms of property rights and protections.  Canadian courts deal with property disputes fairly and in accordance with longstanding legal principles. The government does not arbitrarily take property.  Corruption and bribery are extremely uncommon.

I think Canada is about on par with the US in terms of scope of government spending and regulation.  Things vary of course, but I don't think Canadian government is that much larger than US government.  Healthcare is government paid for the most part, but actually spends less government $ than healthcare in the US.  Taxes are a bit higher, but that mostly reflects lower deficits, not higher spending.

There are a few areas where Canada is notably more regulatory than the US, such as gun rights, but I think on balance the overall freedom from undue incarceration in Canada is significantly better than the US.

This discussion isn't going anywhere until you articulate what your standard of free is. Otherwise, everyone will be using different standards and talking past each other.
Canada is definitely less free in terms of speech, ironically due to their human rights tribunals. Comedians in the US arenâ€™t fined tens of thousands of dollars for their jokes:

On that issue, the human rights tribunals have forced salons to pay fines for being unwilling to wax male genitalia:

The fact that this litigants name was protected by a publication ban is another point against Canada. Prior restraint of the press in the US is unconstitutional per Near v. Minnesota.
Liberty is entirely relative. It's not a point based system where everything is weighed the same. While some people believe an absolute right to vote important, others value their right to arms. One thing that's easily brought up is taxes. Many Canadian products are taxed at a much higher rate than US products. A significant portion of people view taxes as a major liberty they are sacrificing, but to a certain degree. For the people who weigh the liberties Canada offers less than the liberties that US offers, would the US not be a freer country?

Edit: spelling mistakes
The first thing I was to point out is that you made the metric of freedom based on the subjective parameters you set. It's the fact that you've made this so subjective that I question whether or not you're soapboxing.

Many people here might feel American things like gun rights and private health insurance is freer. Regardless of costs.

>I think Canada is substantially freer in terms of democratic participation.

Here's what I'll tackle.

Canada just has its own problems that are unique to us given the structuring of our government. But Canada's governance system is rather terrible and consolidates way too much power within the PMO. This is probably not well understood by both Americans and even Canadians, but the power that a PM has is that of a dictator if they win an election with a majority and given that a majority can be won with a 35% of the popular vote it often happens that a minority of voters "bully" the rest of Canada for 4 years. Canadian prime ministers have way more power than a president as a Canadian PM can:

* The PM of Canada is the boss of the political party that wins the most seats in parliament and MP's (congressmen) under that party barely ever go against the party line, even if the MP's constituency says otherwise.
* The PM can appoint:
   * the entire cabinet of Canada
   * Judges to the supreme court
   * heads of the military
   * president of the state run media
   * BoC governor
   * Appoint senators
   * and just about any other leader of federal government departments
* A PM decisions don't need to be approved by anyone and can't be veto'd by anyone
* Can pass any law at any time they want under a majority
* Kick people out of the party for voting a way that the PM doesn't like

Only 1% of Canadians are a part of political parties and thus eligible of voting for the party leader and the pool of people that can be picked to hold office are expected to be fluent in French; which only 16% of Canadians are. 

It should also be mentioned that I don't think there has been a Prime Minister in the last 40years that hasn't gone through their fair share of corruption scandals. One could only imagine what a Donald Trump would be like in Canada, given the amount of power that the PM holds. 

I would also like to hold the point that due to a type of strange left wing Canadian exceptionalism in comparison to the Americans, actual left wing issues that can help Canadians are over shadowed by populist issues that don't help anyone. Actually in many cases Canadian Liberals are often the ones too privatize, cut unions, and reduce public expenditures on social services like health care. Given the attitude that "at least we're better than the Americans" this stuff gets over shadowed all of the time. Also Canada also suffers from strange left wing populist movements. Let's provide examples:

- BLMTO was a franchised American movement that tried to apply structural American problems to Canada and killed any other organic Canadian black movement in the process. They also tried to over shadow a lot of native isuses by "allying with the natives".

- The biggest women's march in Canadian history was in regards to Donald Trump; a leader of another democratically sovereign country where Canadians have no voting rights in. These protests heavily over shadowed our own women's issues whether it be missing and murder native women, access to abortion issues in Eastern Canada, and various needed medical procedures like pap smears being reduced in areas like Ontario. 

- Our health care system has been in decline for decades due to under funding. This is only ever really a problem to the left wing when there is a Conservative in power to blame, other than that things like Trudeaus lack of spending and Wynnes privatization typically go unnoticed. Again Canadians are pretty complacent with our globally shitty ranking healthcare system out of the argument that "at least we're not the states.

- Some of the biggest privatization initiatives have been implemented by left wing governments in Canada.For example Wynnes privatization of hydro one, or Trudeaus infrastructure privatization. 

So I would argue that because Canadians are so influenceable by the sentiments of American politics that they themselves are less free to influence actual meaningful change in Canada. 

>I think Canada is about on par with the US in terms of property rights and protections. Canadian courts deal with property disputes fairly and in accordance with longstanding legal principles. The government does not arbitrarily take property. Corruption and bribery are extremely uncommon.

That's untrue. [In 2013 Canada dominated the World Banks list of most corrupt countries to do business with due to SNC Lavalin and its subsidiaries.](https://business.financialpost.com/executive/canada-now-dominates-world-bank-corruption-list-thanks-to-snc-lavalin) It should also be noted that this is the same SNC and the current Liberal government are going through a major scandal. 

>I think Canada is about on par with the US in terms of scope of government spending and regulation. Things vary of course, but I don't think Canadian government is that much larger than US government. Healthcare is government paid for the most part, but actually spends less government $ than healthcare in the US. Taxes are a bit higher, but that mostly reflects lower deficits, not higher spending.

No it's not. The Ontario government is in the most sub sovereign debt on the planet. This has been maintained by multiple federal governments that downloads a lot of its financial burdens onto the provinces. It's also hard to make this a metric since taxes can vary from state to state and province to province. One thing that should be noted though if we are talking about economic freedom Canada's interprovincial trade barriers have made up for $100 billion dollars in lost trade opportunity. It's easier for Canadians in many cases to do business with American companies than it is Canadian due to provincial trade barriers. These trade barriers also cause problems when moving from province to province.
Like someone mentioned, my idea of freedom is pretty hardcore libertarian unlike someone who might only point to guns and free speech I look towards can someone live off their owned private property off the grid tax and harrassment free?
Is it easier to start a business in the US or Canada? Which countries have less regulations and taxes for businesses?
Well only thing I can argue is the freedom of speech. Inciting violence or call to action is illegal in which it should. Hate speech regulation is not free speech. 

For example, there is a woman who was jailed hate speech for calling a transgender person, that she was born a man, and they shouldn't be allowed to decide fate of biological women. This isn't hate speech it's an opinion from a biological woman. The trans person is not, in any sense, the opposite sex because they are biologically either male or female.  Hate speech should be free speech because no one can have unbiased objective ideal of what is or isn't hate speech. For example, people who say "I want all black people to die and let's do it tomorrow." That's Inciting violence which is illegal and should be. The reason is different people can define hate speech differently depending how they feel that particular day. 


Same here in the United States that the voting laws. Every American citizen can legally vote unless you have a felony. That's why we (United States) should have everyone should have ID to vote and have a national ID for that purpose. So if they want to vote they can. It's not the govt fault if people don't want to go vote.
