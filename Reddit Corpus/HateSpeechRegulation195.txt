Title: The editor of the New York Times, Dean Baquet, took to social media on Friday to vigorously defend his paper’s decision not to publish the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, calling a critic of the policy an “asshole”.

Wasn't it NYTs that showed the pic of the guy falling in front of a subway on their front page? Seems like that shouldn't have been shown and these pics should. 
The images are part of the story, the reader needs to see them to fully understand what happened. 

Not showing them certainly appears to be a capitulation to the terrorists.

I'd like to see western media end the taboo and make clear that the censorship the fanatics demand is unacceptable and we will no longer attempt compromise on this issue.   
The Ny Times is dead, who cares what an editor from an aging dinosaur of a publication says. They stopped being aggressive journalists years ago.
I find the acts of the terrorists offensive, and I know I'm not in the minority on that.  So, they're perfectly willing to show every moment of that tragedy, but not the content which sparks it, all to avoid offending people who would already be offended?

I call bullshit.
