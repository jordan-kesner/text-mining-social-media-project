Title: CMV: The Founding Fathers of The United States came from an Honor Culture and meant for "Free Speech" to be interpreted through that lens.

Post:
The philosophy of Free Speech in the United Sates is intended to allow people to present ideas that are controversial or unpopular in a way that is productive for democratic dialogue and not be penalized by government institutions for going against the status quo and popular sentiment. The intent was not for people to say disgusting, vile, and hateful things without consequence or recourse. This point is highlighted further when it is taken into consideration that the founders of the US came from an **honor culture**.

The transition of the United States to a Dignity Culture/Victim Culture makes the Founding Fathers views on Free Speech incompatible with modern interpretations or sentiments proposed by Free Speech absolutists and those holding adjacent ideologies. Further, modern Free Speech interpretations by absolutists are un-American and goes against their noble intentions.

For those unfamiliar these are some of the core tenets of honor culture:

- Integrity: In an honor culture, individuals are expected to maintain their personal integrity in **all** aspects of life, including political discourse. Free speech allows for open expression of ideas without fear of retribution or censorship, promoting the truth-seeking process that is essential to a functioning democracy. By encouraging diverse perspectives and **honest** debate, free speech upholds the values of honor and integrity within society.

- Loyalty: Honor cultures often emphasize loyalty to one's family, community, or **nation**. Free speech can be seen as an extension of this value by fostering a sense of loyalty towards the principles of Life, Liberty, Pursuit of Happiness, and Equality upon which the United States was founded. By allowing for open discussion and dissenting opinions, free speech encourages citizens to remain true to their beliefs and convictions while contributing to the larger societal conversation.


- Moral Principles: In an honor culture, individuals are expected to adhere to a strict moral code that governs their **actions** and **behavior**. Free speech supports this by providing a platform for open discussion of ethical issues and moral dilemmas. By allowing citizens to express their views on these matters, free speech encourages reflection and debate about the principles guiding society, ultimately leading to more informed decision-making and collective growth.

- Reputation: In an honor culture, one's reputation is of utmost importance as it reflects personal integrity and moral character. Free speech allows individuals to defend their reputations by openly expressing their views and experiences in public forums. This transparency helps maintain a level playing field where everyone has the opportunity to present their case and be judged fairly based on the merits of their arguments, rather than being silenced or suppressed due to external pressures.

Free speech as envisioned by the Founders of the United States is associated with honor culture values such as integrity, loyalty, and moral principles, its compatibility with dignity/victim culture is questionable due to differences in reputation management, public discourse, morality, and tolerance for inflammatory language. 

**For an easy pathway to being awarded a Delta**: Convince me that the Founding Fathers of the United States were Free Speech absolutists. Alternatively, convince me that they foresaw the transition away from honor culture to dignity/victim culture and factored that in when codifying Free Speech into the constitution.

**For a harder pathway to being awarded a Delta**: Convince me with some other perspective or argument.

The founding fathers published entire newspapers dedicated to calling each other shit-eating horse fuckers, even if they were on the same side politically. There is literally nothing they loved more than talking shit and hiding behind pseudonyms to avoid consequences.
Do you think people don't say disgusting, vile things in an honor culuture? Or that if we were currently in an "honor culture" that folks wouldn't be saying those kind of things?
The founders understood something you did not.  
If there is a category of "acceptable" and "unacceptable" speech, there is a high likelihood that the govt in power will declare that the opposition is making "unacceptable" speech.

The entire idea of the founding fathers was to prevent demagoguery.
This is just wrong on a historical basis, because the idea of "honor culture" did not exist at the time of the Founding Fathers, it being a modern invention that imposes an interpretative framework on the past. That interpretative framework, being modern, would not have been in mind for the Founding Fathers when they wrote their texts. And it is very clear the lens that the Founding Fathers intended "freedom of speech" to be interpreted in, that being the English Common Law that already had similar protections in various jurisdictions, along with the ideas of the Enlightenment more broadly.
Do we not still have a self-policing culture? I mean, we don't have duels, but people still face consequences for poor language from friends, family, bosses/coworkers, etc. The right will even call ot "cancel culture".
An honor culture enables absolute free speech far more than it detracts from it, by assuming people have the honor to not abuse it, respecting them enough to not to put exceptions on free speech or limit it to specific contexts. 

Secondly, they had low class people back then too, and they knew that they would abuse it, and surely considered that simply to be a nessisary evil, as...

Thirdly: A democracy requires free speech, and a couple of farmers screaming at each other are just as much voters as the people properly debating.
This view has no utility. 

The plain reading of the law, common sense constraints (eg fraud need not apply), and centuries of legal precedent give us more than enough information to interpret the law just fine. 

We don’t need some post-hoc description of what early American society may have been like to tell us what to think.
The intent was that no one can decide what is vile and disgusting.

Because if you even say that you shouldn't be allowed to say disgusting things, all it takes is to convince people that something is disgusting and you can censor ANYTHING.

There is nothing that you can't convince people to consider disgusting.

The part your view would struggle explaining is why the 5th US Congress in 1798 passed the Alien and Sedition Act that made criticizing the government illegal. In fact, several publishers were arrested and criminally charged for criticizing the Adams administration. Some of those publishers were Jefferson owned or adjacent newspapers. 

In secret, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison author the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions that argued a state has a right to nullify federal law and threated secession. Also the acts were unpopular and were permitted to expire.

The point, though, shows the attitudes of the "founding fathers" were not uniform. Some made criticizing themselves illegal - but popular pressure was nonetheless felt. 

In reading your article:

> There were no organized parties 

The fourth US Congress had formal political parties (1795) so your article, recounting a 1795 event, doesn't seem accurate factually. 

Or here:

>They were men of integrity and honesty 

The 5th Congress required them to expel William Blount who was trying to sell off Florida for personal gain (even though William Blount signed the Constitution, his land speculation fell on hard times and he needed the cash).

  
Or here:

>by providing leaders with a controlled way of defending themselves against inferiors at a time of crisis . . . \[it was used against inferior people\]

It was used by the Adams administration against Jefferson controlled papers. Jefferson conspired in secret to have states nullify federal law as a response, but it was so unpopular that they let the law expire.
