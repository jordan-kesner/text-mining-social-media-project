I don't see how this is a good investment.


How is this site going to get better? It's been getting *worse* over the years and they dont even bother making the shitty mobile app better after they killed all of the 3rd party ones. 

Like you'd think after killing the 3rd party apps they would put the same functionalities and QoL features in the official one, but nope. It blows and can't even do some of the basic things the desktop site can.
