Title: CMV: Heavy and strict moderation in subs dampen genuine curiosity and partake in censorship that borders on anti-intellectualism.

Post:
I totally understand why a sub would want to maintain a certain tone throughout and have very heavy-handed policies regarding deleting comments.

A lot of subs have suffered degradation because a rise of popularity with poor moderation. 

It's a slippery slope situation and wherever you draw the line you're going to get backlash.

My position is that my frustration with the lines that some subs draw are unreasonable.

Unreasonable because sometimes in odd corners of the internet you find environment that host lively conversations that you can't find elsewhere.

It's like natural climate the springs up life. And each life is specific to that climate.

I understand that I can go to a different sub that is more relevant. But the conversation itself that was deleted cannot reoccur in the same way. The climate will change the conversation. Like a species of butterfly changing colors because of environmental changes.

If the conversation itself is not harming anyone and maintains the mature, intellectually curious tone the sub seems to encourage, I don't see the issue.

This is the message I sent the moderators (I edited a bit so it wasn't clear what subs I'm talking about):

I get it that it's a strict sub and it's heavily moderated so things don't get out of control.

But the comments I presented weren't inflammatory. They may have been off-topic, but they originated from of the comments that wasn't deemed off-topic. I think it's a reasonable request that a conversation organically sprouting from comments isn't seen on the same level as unwanted comments.

The comments were based on reason and it was a mature back and forth with another user. 

You guys may argue that this isn't the place for mature discussion that doesn't involve the topic (and I can understand that) but it's not everywhere that such a back and forth can organically spring.

I can go to another sub where the topic is relevant but doing so would be changing the environment and climate of the discussion with a different audience (the user with who I was talking to may not even visit). So the conversation that springs forth would be a totally different species. 

It just seems anti-intellectualism to censor people like that when an honest to goodness discussion is occurring.

You guys probably have reasons to believe that such comments degrade the sub or lead to childish arguments and I respect that. I barely post on these subs because I know you guys are strict. But when I do comment, I do try to maintain a sincerely neutral, open minded tone to avoid being deleted.

I don't really care back to hear from you guys since I don't comment here often but just to let you know that censorship and over-sweeping silencing of people shouldn't be something encouraged for people that like to expand understanding.

Except that basically everyone agrees that /r/askhistorians is one of the best subs out there. It's also known for it's incredibly heavy censorship and modding.
Looking through your post history it seems you were having an off topic conversation in r/science that was filled with conjecture, speculation, and assumption. All of which is the antithesis of what the mods at that sub want it to be.

Sure, it sucks that you were having a fun time idly speculating on a tangential subject and that the runtimes ended because you picked the wrong venue, but it isn't censorship to have and maintain standards of discourse and evidence and it is pretty much the opposite of anti-intelectual to require proof of your claims.

r/science is a specific sub created and maintained to a specific end goal and your behavoir fell outside of that. 

Speaking to your OP here: It is certainly possible that heavy moderation **can** be stifling to creativity, etc. But that only matters in circumstances were the end goal of that venue in question is to foster creativity. r/science ain't that venue.
> If the conversation itself is not harming anyone and maintains the mature, intellectually curious tone the sub seems to encourage, I don't see the issue.

I think the issue is reddit's differing mores depending on the sub you're in.  People have used the /r/AskHistorians sub rules as an example of positive moderation, but similar moderation in other subs have been detrimental.  Plus, there are more than enough subs with poor moderation that make you feel this way even though it's not true of all subs.

So I don't think your question is true in all circumstances.  The real answer is "it depends."  
Clarifying question: without context, it’s impossible to know whether the removal is reasonable or unreasonable. 

Can you give us some more context?  You tried to write a general view, but it’s hard to comment without context.  All we have is your side of the story, not the whole story.
You're dancing around it, but the real problems are political subs like /r/The_Donald and /r/Feminism that extremely heavily moderate opposing political views.

Please note that a change of view [doesn't necessarily mean a reversal](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_a_.27view.27.3F), or that the conversation has ended.

I'm sorry but this doesn't sound like an argument for why a sub cannot lessen their strangle over posts.

And just to make it clear, I'm not talking about /r/AskHistorians but will use it as an example.

I realize that a lot of the major threads in response to OP are heavily moderated because those are meant to be used by historians answering OP.

But what I'm talking about is the discussion that springs from those major threads into smaller threads and that eventually lead to conversations. 

Some of those back and forth may degrade into silliness but some of those conversation are not on the same level as silly immaturity.

I'll give you a delta because I am sympathetic and can appreciate that moderators are working in unfamiliar terrain and invoke different tactics to make their sub successful. Plus a lot of times the moderators are volunteers and it's a lot of work. And if it works, why fix it? 

As the saying goes, to make omelets you have to crack a few eggs.

But apart from that, I think that my criticism isn't without merit and that some moderation is too strict and dampens conversations that shouldn't be discouraged. And if it's a legit criticism, then maybe some things may be tried to avoid that.


I mean, objectively, the main comment was on topic but it started a conversation that was off topic.

But that conversation itself (from my perspective) was mature, reasonable, and respectful and didn't affect the quality of the thread or sub.

An answer would be to take the conversation somewhere else but I just stated that the conversation happened organically between two people and then it was cut off at its roots.

You can plant that seed in a more relevant sub but it's going to sprout into a totally different conversation. So it's not the same thing.
