Title: Does anyone else think Facebook’s censorship and ease with which they hand out bans for bullshit reasons is ridiculous?

Post:
I’ve been given 3-7 day account suspensions for absolute bullshit, like saying fuck or trading jokes in private groups. I’ve never once said anything racist or discriminatory, and rarely post political opinions because I have heard about how strict they are. 

It’s fucking bullshit, as they have a monopoly on social media and other than Reddit they are the only message board left that anyone uses so I’m forced to use it to discuss my hobbies. It is absolutely infuriating to me that I am forced to walk on egg shells with every last comment I post out of fear of getting zucked.

Have they always been this strict? I have only been actively using Facebook as a message board for a year or so since there seem to be almost no active message boards left. When did they all die? Reddit is pretty incredible for having a forum for literally every subject but they are equally or even more strict. 

It’s incredibly irritating, unless you are actively spewing hate speech or inciting violence who the fuck cares what people say? Moderate within reason but fuck it’s gotten out of control and made what was once the most enjoyable part of the Internet a stressful and annoying cesspool of echo chambers and toxicity.

Facebook has overstayed it’s welcome anyway and is long overdue for a replacement, and by swallowing up Instagram and becoming a monopolistic conglomerate hopefully they get hit with an anti trust lawsuit and knocked down a peg leaving the door open for a less draconian company.

I think they need broken up. 
I got banned for 3 days and on restriction for 30 days for telling a person this "that's dumb, lol".
I was banned for 3 days for posting a screen shot of a stock market trade I made. It’s absolutely ridiculous. Now I spend most of my time on Reddit. Way better.
Stop using FB then if you are no longer happy with the free services in exchange for your attention and ad data.  Reddit is great because every sub is moderated differently.  Also try out Clubhouse or Discord, tons of niche and hobbyist communities going on in both.
They disabled my account cause I couldn't provide them with a Mobile cell phone number where they could bombard me with even more fucking ads!  Discrimination!
FB is a total waste.  The sooner u rid yourself of it the better u r going 2 feel about urself & the real world.
