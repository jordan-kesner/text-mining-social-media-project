Title: Cons of Social Media Apps

Post:
Doing a research paper and would like some input on what you would want to see in a social media?

What do you hate about these apps?

* Twitter (x)?
* Instagram
* Facebook

This could be the explicit content, hate speech/cyber bullying, etc. Whatever you would want to see improved. I am looking to write a research paper on what the effects of social media is. Thanks in advance!

You mention this is for a research paper. Have you already started pulling out themes you're seeing in social media-related research studies that were done from, say, 2020 onwards?

I'd gently nudge you to explore what Google Scholar has to offer first since I'm not positive that quoting folks off Reddit is the best approach to kick off this paper. Best of luck.
Distraction and addiction are the two biggest cons of using those social media sites you mentioned. It disconnect some people from reality which is very bad. I can't say enough about how toxic those platforms can be.Â
