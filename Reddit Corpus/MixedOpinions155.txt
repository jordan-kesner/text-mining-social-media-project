Title: CMV: Using the LGBTTQQPAAS2 acronym doesn't represent the gay community and so shouldn't be used.

Post:
I'm still stunned that this is even a thing. I need to be sold on this.    
   
I've been out since the mid 80's and was active in the Gay Community which became the Lesbian & Gay Community which then became the LGBT, then LGBTQ Community until the mid 90's. Cut to today, someone called me a cis-gay man and a very confusing Google search lead me to that acronym.   
   
Lesbian  
Gay   
Bisexual   
Transgender   
Transexual   
Queer   
Questioning   
Asexual    
Ally   
Pansexual   
2 Spirit    
Community.    
    
I can't be the only gay person who thinks that is a bit much? I'm willing to be open minded, but why? Transgendered and Transexual people aren't usually even gay.      
    
Come on, help me out here. Why should we have gotten this complex?   
    
(And please, don't shout. I will not respond to one word answers or name calling.)

**EDIT: There are a lot of comments and discussions in the thread, many are tangential, but all are worth reading. Regarding the CMV aspect of the thread, the argument which CedMV is the following:**   

**LGBT vs LGBT+/LGBTQ/LGBTQ+/ad infinitum is what is used in the social movement while all the others lead up to a visual reminder that the movement is inclusive of other peoples. Said differently, LGBT is practical; alphabet soup is symbolic.**  
   
You're welcome to add comments to the thread but I don't know if I, the OP, will continue answering new questions/comments. 
  
Thank you all for the discussion.

Actually as I understand it trans people are hugely more likely to identify as gay or bi than the cis population.

Plus gay/bi people are much more likely to identify as gender non conforming than straight people.

There's a clear relationship.

I always thought GSM, Gender and Sexual Minorities was a pretty neat way of categorizing the politics.



> Transgendered and Transexual people aren't usually even gay.

Which is why they need their own letter, right?

I'm *not* LGBT, but I see it as an umbrella term for basically anyone who isn't part of the straight-male/straight-female normative standard.  Self-righteous assholes discriminate against gay people and trans people alike, so there should be a way to refer to all sexually marginalized people as a group.  I personally don't like the jumbles of letters either, though.  I even think "LGBT" is too much, and "LGBTQ" is one letter worse.  But I'm not actually part of the LGBT(Q) community, so it's not my place to say.  If it were up to me, I'd pick a single word or phrase (that isn't something negative like "sexually marginalized").  I like "queer", which I've seen a lot of LGBT people use.

The letters do have the advantage of explicitly showing people that the community is made up of people with many different positions.  A person may be gay and that describes the person, but LGBT(Q) describes the community.

On the other hand, LGBTTQQPAAS2 is fucking insane.  I've never seen it before and I hope never to see it again.  That's like referring to the United States as AAAACCCDFGHI...WWWT, where each letter is one state (the T at the end stands for "and territories").  But then you'd have to add DC, and overseas holdings like DOD bases and DOS embassies and whatnot, which aren't territories.  They're not even states!  Why are they part of the United States?  (That's a rhetorical question!)

As for the acronym not representing the gay community... it doesn't.  I mean, it represents a wider community than just gay people.  I think that the people who added the B's, T's, and Q's were doing this on purpose.
So, you're going to see a lot of conflicting answers because people have a lot of conflicting beliefs.

But it was always the LGBT community rather than the gay community. Bisexual transgender women started the Stonewall riots that kickstarted the modern gay rights movement. It's just that no distinction was really made between gay, bi, and trans people. If you had a penis and had sex with someone who also had a penis, you were gay and that was that.

Nowadays, we have more and better terminology for people, so many people think the acronym should be expanded. But that's a hell of a can of worms, especially when it comes to the inclusion/exclusion of het asexual people in the LGBT community.
I've personally never heard of such a long acronym. I'm also gay and involved in many online and in person gay circles including typical gaybros to militant social justice members of the community. The generally accepted acronym across all groups is LGBTQIA

Lesbian

Gay

Bisexual

Trans*

Queer

Intersex

Asexual

Most people would not include ally in the community that I have talked to. Same with the term "questioning." That's a debate for another day though. Trans* typically includes both transsexual and transgender. Pansexual, two spirit, etc. are generally included under the term "queer." 

But even this shortened acronym is generally abbreviated to LGBT+. 

I agree that it is ridiculous but I think you overestimate the number of people that actually use that cumbersome acronym. In common use, I have only ever seen LGBTQIA as the longest one used. 
Out of curiosity, does the phrase 'gender and sexual minorities'/acronym GSM have much traction? I've heard it used a few times and it seems both concise and inclusive, and can include polyamory as well. What are the feelings around it within LGBT+ communities? 
The premise of the gay rights movement isn't that gay people specifically are a special, unique group who deserve special, unique consideration, it's that people - all people - shouldn't be discriminated against and deprived of fundamental rights on the basis of their sexuality/sexual identity/orientation, whatever you want to call it.

The fact that public opinion has shifted to a point where gay people are largely accepted in the mainstream doesn't change the basic ethos of the movement and it doesn't mean that the problem it addressed is solved. The same reasoning that validates gay rights also validates the rights of other, more marginal groups, so it makes sense to include them in the conversation.
One clue that might help you understand the puzzle is this:

Most of the violence that targets "gay men" really targets gender non-conformity. If a gay man blends in (i.e. fits within the current cultural norm of masculinity) he is much less likely to be a victim of homophobic violence than a guy who breaks gender norms. 

You can deal with this in two ways: conform (which I think is a shitty option that would impoverish humanity) or try to widen the norms so that they aren't as constricting. If you choose the latter, then all of a sudden it makes more sense to include other groups that have the same issues. And since the norm of masculinity and femininity is so tightly connected to sex, it's not far fetched to include things like "asexual". 
"Transgendered and Transexual people aren't usually even gay." made me laugh because my experience says the opposite :P

The reason we use LGBT(etc) is because there are a number of common experiences shared by many of the people in these categories. Discrimination, for not abiding by traditional western ideals of gender.

I.e.: If you're born with a penis you must be a man and you must be attracted to women and you must abide by masculine/male gender roles. If you're born with a vagina you must be a woman and you must be attracted to men and you must abide by feminine/female gender roles.

A cisgender gay man is scorned for going against these ideals. So is a transgender straight woman. They're discriminated against for differing reasons but the source is the same: those discriminatory ideals that dictate how men and women must be and behave.

As for how the acronym got so complex... well, that's actually a topic of debate in the community. People have got upset in the past about not being represented by it - and I think their upset is fair if you consider that even the B and T of the original 4-letter acronym were barely recognised until recent years.

The reason it's a problem is because while there's common issues, there's also some specific issues that each group faces! Transgender issues in particular are very distinct from sexuality-related issues, even if there is some overlap in the symptoms and causes. Both bisexual and transgender people often face discrimination from other members of the community, even! If wholly HALF of the identities represented by the LGBT acronym barely get their fair share of recognition, what hope do others have if their issues don't even get a letter in it to begin with?!

In the end, it's a matter of visibility and of solidarity. To say that we all care about Transgender people, Pansexual people, Asexual people, Intersex people and 2-Spirited people just as much as Gay and Lesbian people! That their causes and contributions are just as valid and welcome.

You're not going to see it get much use generally because it's generally unnecessary unless you want to highlight the contributions of all these other "sects" of the community. Most people will go with LGBT+ to highlight the (etc) part of the acronym. Others have suggested more generic acronyms like MOGAI (Marginalised Orientations, Gender Alignments and Intersex).

I'll conclude with a simple answer to your question: Why has it got this complex? Because the issues **are** complex! There are a whole wide spectrum of troubles faced by people marginalised for just being different in some way. By including them in the acronym we say that all their troubles are valid and we're all in it together, to co-operate, to help each other until we all have recognition and respect.
