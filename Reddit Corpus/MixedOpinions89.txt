Title: CMV: Climate change should be the the focus in upcoming elections.

Post:
As we move into a new round of important elections, at least in the US, politicians should put their plans for combating climate change front and center, and deeply criticizes those who deny it. As nations and individuals we really need to act quickly in order to limit the damage. I know saying "should" can be the wrong word to use but I believe it would would show the candidate to be corrupt or ignorant if they don't address the issue. 

There are many issues that face us as a society, but climate change is the one most likely to threaten our core way of life if nothing is done. I don't think there is any other issue that should trump that of climate change in terms of immediate importance. It is on the same level as the threat of global nuclear war, which rightfully received this kind of attention during the cold war when it was especially likely.

The US is on track to hit its Paris Accord targets despite Trump being adamantly against continued participation in the proposal.

This indicates that executive-level discussion (i.e. presidential-level discourse) is either insignificant, or actually irrelevant, to the market forces and local policies driving our participation in climate change reduction.

So, you're not wrong that climate change is important to address—it's just that our big-name elections have little bearing on the solutions, which are mostly driven by the market.  If everyone swapped out beef consumption for beans, for example, we'd hit our 2060 targets by 2020.  There are some arguments for carbon tax, but at this rate, those are ancillary to the market changes already occurring.  States like CA (the fifth largest economy in the world) are on track for carbon neutrality by 2045.

In addition, climate change is an overwhelmingly global initiative.  China hit its 2020 targets three years early.

In our endless struggle to compete with emerging superpowers, the US will push to meet those numbers.  Plus, we bet $100 billion dollars per year that we would meet them.

There are way too many incentives for the election rhetoric to have significant bearing on meeting our goals.  It could help, don't get me wrong, but by no means needs to be the "most important" discussion.
Climate change is an issue of good governance.  What's needed is for it to *not* be a political issue, in the same way that food safety is not a political issue.  We need policy to be made by specialists who understand the issues and trade-offs, and we need the public to trust that the specialists are doing their job correctly.

If nobody in the public gave a crap about climate change policy, we would already be doing the right thing.  Career bureaucrats would go to international panels and come home and set policy and it would all just work.  We would have dealt with the issue in the 1970s and massive changes to society would never have been needed.  It is precisely because it *is* a political issue that we're in this mess.

So I see this as a symptom.  The underlying pathology is (a) money in politics, (b) lack of public trust in government, and (c) the rise of alternative facts and fake news.  (And by fake news I mean both actually-fake news planted by agitators, and using the "fake news" epithet to discredit news that is, in fact, true.)

tl;dr - If you want to solve climate change, or any other issue facing us, the critical thing is to elect a *competent* government that is at least *trying* to take a serious path to solving society's problems.
You are in the vast minority in that you consider this to be an important political topic.  In a [Pew Research Poll conducted in June 2018](http://www.people-press.org/2018/06/20/2-the-2018-congressional-election/), climate change wasn't even amongst the top 10 most important issues to voters.

Even the more broad topic of "the environment" was only considered to be an important issue by 4% of those polled, [and even amongst Democrats, only 5% considered the environment to be an important topic](https://i.imgur.com/QMkCwW1.jpg)

Wouldn't you agree that politicians who want to get elected should spend their time focusing on what the majority of likely voters care about, and not just what /u/7sidedcube cares about?  Even if they are individually focused on climate change, they are unlikely to get elected and be able to do anything about it if they don't focus their campaign on the topics that people actually care about.
Between 2016 and 2017, the United States reduced  its carbon emissions by more than any other country in the world, nearly 42 million tons or .5% of its total emissions.

I think it's safe to say that wasn't because of any new harcore regulation, new laws or anything else the government could do. The private sector is moving towards green energy, so there really isn't much that a person can do by voting. Rather, buying green products is the way to improve the environment. Even without the Paris Climate agreement or an aggressive EPA, we are still trending better than any other country
It doesn’t need to be a focus, just say “I agree with a carbon tax” or “I don’t agree with a carbon tax,” and move on from there.

Everything else is a waste of time, especially what’s usually involved when politicians “focus” on a subject.

Instead that fixing our democracy must be the top priority in all elections because until we do so, our voices don't make it through to the other end. Gerrymandering improperly represents us. First past the post, leads to people scared to vote for the candidate they truly believe in. Campaign finance law gives those who most profit from today near veto power over who comes out the other end. The electoral college means that the ideas we most care about don't necessarily go into play. The commission on presidential debates builds a lack of credibility for third party candidates into the process. Even the best intentioned lobbyists skew the time and research of arguments toward one side at the expense of voters. Trying to solve everything at the federal level is a scale so large that painful compromise is inevitable due to the huge diversity of situations and cultures of our states and the untenable scale at which the "dialog" and compromise occurs. Meanwhile, we're afraid of data. We don't mandate recounts and audits of elections. We don't mandate a level of ballot security or integrity. We don't have a clear standard of ballot access. We don't guarantee states the resources to run a secure and smooth election. We don't guarantee citizens the resources to achieve the precursors to qualifying to vote and to submitting their vote regardless of their financial situation or work schedule. Any issues that you think should result from our democracy, should have the precursor of fixing that democracy.
I disagree, basic fucking intelligence and dignity should.

Which climate change would fall under that umbrella.

To stand up and say " let's fight climate change! " would be a selling point. Be a fucking human being, address issues but, to tap on hot buttons like climate change is just another politician selling themselves.

I'm not saying it shouldn't be in there, but, again hot button. The people will praise an ass hole because,

They want to fight climate change!

They stand for equality!

They understand a wall is a waste of everyone's time and resources!

When in turn they have zero interest in follow through (like the majority of politicians)

They have limited to real world experience , (I.e. outside  surrounding themselves with million/billionaires )

Give me some mother fucker that has basic real world science, years of experience interacting with demographics of people that make less than 50k a year (and I fucking said years not a damn summer internship)

Someone who comes with a plan and who they are involving to get it done.
A back up plan for when the opposing party stacks against them they can still execute says plan.

Obama was a well spoken individual and I'm not saying im a supporter of him as much as I am saying that when the entire house was the opposing party and any intention he had just became "stuck" if you will, that sucks.

The fucking shit hole that he walked into when he took office was insane. Again, I'm not saying im a supporter but I felt from the beginning that who ever inherits the problems that vp Bush and president Cheney did to this country, if that person can do anything aside from make it worse they deserve a medal.

And mandatory addressing the issue of "the elite"
Unfortunate we won't behead them however if we could take the rug out from under there feet maybe we could at least spike against them and buy humanity a couple more decades before we inevitably kill ourselves and this planet.

I feel our best attempt at that is to dive headfirst into education.

I mean seriously a society where the very people that are educating the generations to come having to struggle in the bottom brackets has got to be the most asinine embarrassment In the history of any establishment that is not intent draconian style governing.

My apologies that turned into a rant.
