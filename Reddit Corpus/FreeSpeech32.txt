Title: Elon Musk 'Free Speech' Thread | Elon Musk has Never Been an Advocate for Free Speech

Post:
# Elon Musk "Free Speech" Thread

Elon Musk is again claiming that he’s all about free speech. So let’s look at the record. Here’s thread with just a few of the countless examples showing he couldn't care about it less


## 1
There's the time he called Vernon Unsworth, the man who helped rescue 12 boys trapped in a mine in Thailand, a “pedo guy” and paid $50,000 to an investigator to dig up Unsworth’s life. Why? Because Unsworth called his failed attempt help the boys himself a “PR stunt.”


## 2
Then there's the story of John Bernal, who was fired six days after posting a YouTube video of a Tesla accident.

Then, there's Martin Tripp, a technician at a Tesla plant in Nevada who blew the whistle on the company. Musk allegedly hired people to hack and spy on Tripp after he cast doubts on Tesla’s environmental credentials.

Musk also is anti free-speech when it comes to labor organizing. Tesla worker Richard Ortiz was fired for trying to organize with the United Auto Workers, a move that was declared illegal by a labor board.

# Conclusion
Hope it goes without saying but this is much bigger than one billionaire being a fraud and a liar. Our public squares and media platforms should not be for-profit entities and they certainly shouldn’t be controlled by the richest people on earth.

# Solution? Fediverse!
The Federated Universe (*[Fediverse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse)*). A social network nobody owns, run by the people for the people in a communal effort. Entirely free and open source (100% transparent). **ad free**. **spyware-free**. Decentralized (*but not in the stupid crypto kinda way*). 

Used by all data privacy advocates, even many government institutions from all around the world! 

**Mastodon** is the most well known Fediverse software, but not the only one! There are many out there such as **Friendica**, **GNU Social**, **Pleroma**... and 50+ more! From video streaming (*PeerTube*), to Twitter / Facebook-like platforms (*Pleroma, Mastodon, Friendica*), to Instagram-Like platforms (*Pixelfed*), even Twitch-like streaming platforms exist on the Fediverse (OwnCast)

The internet can become a lot more interconnected, interoperable and free, instead of being oppressed and owned by billionaires! 6 Media corporations own 90%+ of all news in the United States and abroad. The CIA owns 260+ media organizations globally, and those are the people trying to explain to you what freedom of press, free thought and free speech is? [You Never Had Original Thought](https://youtu.be/AX8Ct9fhO60), revolt against the media machine, become part of the Federated Universe,, don't just trust someone and hope they'll bring you free speech, no centralized entity could ever do so!

I love how people say that a billionaire shouldn’t control the public square. Never heard anyone complaining about the billionaires that control face book or amazon.
Question to those who think Elon is not pro-free speech. What Jack and other leadership pro-free speech?

I am sure I could easily find 9 or more instances showing they are not.
I’ll truly never understand this bandwagon of hating the only notable billionaire in the world that’s actively supporting the advancement of our technology, comfort in general life, all in ways the government never could, and seemingly unlike any other person with the means and resources to initiate change like he has. People pick him apart based off of their tainted sense of morality, when he’s only made smart moves for him- just like ANY of us .. with any sense would do in his shoes. To think anyone knows the half of it with any smear campaign he’s dragged into.. as if we all understand the mechanics and scorned relationships and whatever else may be influencing his decisions.. he’s still the only guy.. the only one who even pretends to give a shit about the future. Crazy how easily swayed people are with their emotions scrambled by misconstrued talking points and a seemingly endless cycle of massive stretches of the truth in all media nowadays. Do you actually not like him? Or were you just told not to like him with some flimsy bs attack you saw on Facebook or something haha be real with yourself now- no reason to hate the guy, let alone dislike him
I'm with you except for state nationalized control of speech. That's worse than a private billionaire.

I'm skeptical that Musk will make good on his promises. But if he does, then it's a good thing. Time will tell.
Eh, Musk is 1,000,000 times better than any of far left authoritarian tech companies who control everything like Google, Apple, Amazon, etc, etc
so much effort for nothing, i dont care if kim jun un himself bought twitter, if they promise free speech then there is no lose situation. There was no free speech on twitter, any potential improvement is welcomed, and if elon ruins it so what? the platform is toxic anyway
OP, i respect you for calling Elon Musk out. A lot of fans idolise him but don't realise that he's probably has a lot of skeletons in his closet like a lot of billionaires. The right like him now but that could always change.
