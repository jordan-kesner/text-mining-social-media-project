Title: CMV: Advocating against the carrying of firearms is the incorrect way to address gun violence in the US. Addressing mental health and progressive education is the way.

Post:
Before people start jumping down my throat for what seems like a trigger post, please read. I believe that there is a problem with the current state of guns in the US, however I think it has nothing to do with one's ability to hold a firearm in public or concealed. Here is where I stand:

Gun violence in the US is rooted in the fact that majority of cases are instances of suicide. With that in mind, there should be a framework instated within the public to really understand and work towards helping those with mental health issues cope. 

Additionally, the cases where gun violence is not self-inflicted, they are overwhelmingly located in areas of low-income black neighborhoods. This brings me to believe that gang-violence is a huge factor in this. Again, to provide education into combating gang-violence is another outlet to combating gun-violence in the US.

Now to address mass shootings, please keep in mind these are rare occurrances in relation to all other forms of gun-violence. Mass shootings have historically been committed by someone deemed mentally unfit. As well, there have been indicators that the guns have either not been owned by the shooter or they were not obtained legally. This brings me to my last point, we should be reexaminng the vetting process for how to obtain a firearm. We should be employing incentives for registration and promoting proper gun handling for both the retailer and the customer. Provide mandatory educational classes on how to handle firearms whether it be recreationally, defensively, and ESPECIALLY STORAGE. Like I said, the other facet of this is always ensuring to provide an outlet for mental health.

Just to add, can someone explain to me their rationale against why the public should have access to firearms? Why should someone not have protection with them especially in cases where they have the potential to save theirs, but others lives as well.

Thanks.

Going out to lunch so it will be a bit to digest your opinions. This is a heavy topic as well so I want to speak thoughtfully on this.


Edit: Back and reading through the comments. Just to note, I found that my claim that mass shootings are due to mental illness is not true. The data doesn't indicate a higher tendency for gun violence to be perpetuated by a mentally ill person vs a mentally fit person. Sorry for this. Let me know anything else I am wrong on!


2nd Edit: Still at the office and going in for a conference call. Keep posting so I can read your thoughts!

3rd Edit: Wow thanks to the anonymous redditor for the gold! It's good to be honest!

So, I was hoping I could address some of your points as an MSW student, which puts me right at the crossroads of mental health, political policy, and education. Before I begin though, I feel like I should put my own political stance/biases out there, so that you know where my argument comes from. Personally, I'm not against guns, and actually like shooting, but think that firearm laws are generally way too lax, and that we should take some steps to increase gun control. Now, with that having been said, I want to break down your post piece by piece. 

>Gun violence in the US is rooted in the fact that majority of cases are instances of suicide. With that in mind, there should be a framework instated within the public to really understand and work towards helping those with mental health issues cope.

So, the issue you touched upon here is tricky, because while its *technically* true, it misses a larger point. I agree that we should be putting more resources into mental healthcare, but guns present a risk for suicidal individuals that can't be addressed via better treatment alone. To understand why, we have to reframe our understanding of suicide a little bit. In many suicides and suicide attempts, the decision to take one's life isn't a long-term plan, but instead a fairly impulsive decision. This means that having access to a tool which can easily and reliably end a life, such as a gun, significantly raises the chance that an individual will both act on an impulse to kill themselves, and be successful in doing so. Even if we were able to substantially improve care for individuals with suicidal ideation, having access to a firearm would present a unique and significant risk. As such, while I admittedly don't know what a solution to this issue should look like, we can't act as if improved mental healthcare is going to erase the problem of the exorbitant rate of suicides using firearms.    
>Additionally, the cases where gun violence is not self-inflicted, they are overwhelmingly located in areas of low-income black neighborhoods. This brings me to believe that gang-violence is a huge factor in this. Again, to provide education into combating gang-violence is another outlet to combating gun-violence in the US.

Again, while you are technically correct that gangs have a roll in gun violence, I would caution against discounting the roll of firearms so quickly. It would likely be erroneous to assume that rates of violent gang related crime would remain unchanged if we limited access to guns; by eliminating the best tool for attacking another person, we create a barrier that would likely prevent some assaults and murders from ever being attempted. It is the widespread access to firearms, not simply the presence of gangs alone, that makes gang violence so dangerous. 

> Now to address mass shootings, please keep in mind these are rare occurrances in relation to all other forms of gun-violence. Mass shootings have historically been committed by someone deemed mentally unfit. As well, there have been indicators that the guns have either not been owned by the shooter or they were not obtained legally.

So, I really wanted to speak to this section of your argument, because while what you stated seems like common sense, and is often held as true in political discussion, it isn't backed up by the facts. Even though mental illness is often used to explain the actions of mass shooters, [a significant majority of those who commit these crimes have no treatable mental illness](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/most-mass-shooters-arent-mentally-ill-so-why-push-better-treatment-as-the-answer/2016/05/17/70034918-1308-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12_story.html?utm_term=.ac7d17fee2d6). Of further note, and again running contrary to popular accounts, [the vast majority of these shooters are able to obtain their guns legally](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/more-80-percent-guns-used-mass-shootings-obtained-legally-n474441). While we might be able to slightly limit mass shooting via better mental healthcare, assuming that we could find and help those who become violent as a result of their illnesses, this is far from an effective solution. If we want to address mass gun violence, we need to discuss gun control.

> We should be employing incentives for registration and promoting proper gun handling for both the retailer and the customer. Provide mandatory educational classes on how to handle firearms whether it be recreationally, defensively, and ESPECIALLY STORAGE.

So, I actually really agree with this. Considering how dangerous guns can be when used incorrectly, its insane just how little education/licencing you need in many states to obtain one. I don't have evidence for this on hand, but I'm guessing if we made licencing more difficult and imposed higher requirements for training, we might see huge decreases in violence. 
>Just to add, can someone explain to me their rationale against why the public should have access to firearms? Why should someone not have protection with them especially in cases where they have the potential to save theirs, but others lives as well.

So, this is a good question, and I would love if there were more studies on the issue (funding for research on gun violence has been heavily restricted due to political interference). However, some of the data we do have suggests that access to firearms, and the ability to carry them in public, doesn't make people more safe. To the contrary, [allowing individuals to carry firearms has been significantly correlated to an immediate increase in violent crime, and rates of violence seem to gradually increase the longer right to carry laws stay on the books](https://works.bepress.com/john_donohue/163/). The idea of carrying a firearm to protect oneself plays to our nation's sense of individualism and collective imagination, but data seems to suggest that this is a **terrible** way to promote public safety.  

One is allowed to do many things to solve a problem.

I am a liberal. I have had this conversation with conservatives who say "no, the real problem is mental health". Then a week later they'll talk about how they hate how their hard earned money goes to pay for other people's medical treatment.

I think it is likely that the vast majority of those who want stricter gun control also want better mental health resources and access to healthcare.

This is a tried and true tactic. Kick the real issue where it is tough to sustain a position into another arena. In this case, kick gun laws into healthcare. Once it's in healthcare, tie the argument up in a discussion on taxes. Background checks are simple; healthcare and taxes are not. 

Then nothing has to happen.
While healthcare and education are important, I would argue that the bigger issue is poverty itself. Violent crime would most effectively be reduced by getting people out of poverty. People get violent when they are desperate, and desperation is a result of poverty.
I'm fine with taking on mental health but you have to have some regulatory policies in place if you want to do that. I'm a mental health professional. If I identify a patient who should not have access to a weapon, I currently have very few options available. I can put the person in the emergency room with an officer outside, but that is pretty extreme and the person will be out in 72 hours regardless. We don't lock people up indefinitely because they might hurt people. 

The obvious answer here would be that if I identify a person who is unstable and shouldn't have a weapon, that I then use a registry to prevent them from purchasing a weapon. The problem is that such a registry doesn't exist and most gun rights advocates fight tooth and nail to prevent one. If you don't give me a registry, I'm completely powerless as a professional as I can do nothing to prevent a probable gunmen from killing lots of people. Unless I'm very certain that it is an imminent threat, I can't even warn people that this person might be dangerous. Of course I can treat the person, but that is a long term strategy. We must have some reasonable way to keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill people who are judged to be a threat to themselves or others. 
Whenever this issue comes up I'm always conflicted; there are a million different ways of describing the problem, and equally many proposed solutions. I've seen countless case studies of other countries' gun laws and corresponding crime statistics, all of which are compelling and "prove" different points, but unfortunately they all seem to conflict with one another. And none of them are perfect matches for our situation, either.

There's one thing I think we should all be able to agree on: science! We need more data. The more research we throw at the problem, the clearer it will become. [Unfortunately, in the US, it's effectively illegal to use government funds to research the causes of gun violence, and it has been for over 20 years.](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-gun-research-funding-20160614-snap-story.html) That's what I think both sides of the issue should be able to work together on, finding concrete data instead of basing our positions on anecdotes and conventional wisdom.

Edit: it's only government-funded research through the CDC that's prevented by the Dickey Amendment, not actually all research. Privately-funded research isn't punishable.
> We should be employing incentives for registration and promoting proper gun handling for both the retailer and the customer. Provide mandatory educational classes on how to handle firearms whether it be recreationally, defensively, and ESPECIALLY STORAGE.

What benefits are there to registration over our current system? What will mandatory education classes really change?

Do I understand you correctly?  You admit that people do bad things with guns they don't get through normal, legal channels, and because of that, you want to review the legal channels they didn't use to get their guns?

I mean, I agree with a lot of the rest of your post, and your position, but that line of thinking just doesn't make sense to me.
