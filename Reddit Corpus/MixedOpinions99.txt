Title: Do Images that depict ones political enemies as "less than human" concern you?

Post:
This has been some what popular lately but I just saw a picture while browsing r/all that reminded me of how popular it has again become to do such a thing.

The Nazis depicted Jewish people as [less than human](https://www.google.com/search?q=nazi+propaganda+posters+against+jews&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiEzMXot_joAhUU3KwKHVS4DKAQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=nazi+propaganda+posters&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgBMgIIADIECAAQQzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAUJLjAljKgANgmI4DaABwAHgAgAHBAYgB5BSSAQQ4LjE1mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&sclient=img&ei=j1WeXsTIMJS4swXU8LKACg&bih=632&biw=1366)

Racists have depicted minorities as [less than human](https://www.google.com/search?q=racist+propaganda+posters&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjv0Oa5uPjoAhVHs6wKHQHUBqYQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=racist+pro&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgBMgQIABBDMgQIABBDMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BAgAEANQ23BY83pgoYsBaABwAHgAgAGkAYgBswqSAQMxLjmYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZw&sclient=img&ei=OlaeXu_LDMfmsgWBqJuwCg&bih=632&biw=1366)

And lately its become pretty socially acceptable to depict your political opponents as less than human. I will attempt to attach the picture alone without "cross posting" anything, as it depicts Trump supporters/protestors as mindless zombies.

Lastly here is an NPR article that discusses the dangers of dehumanizing people as it allows people to do horrible things to others they wouldn't normally do.

Do you think this kind of thing can be dangerous?

Do you think this kind of thing should be moderated by Reddit like it moderates other "dangerous" speech?

I agree, dehumanizing people you disagree with is dangerous and really lacking in empathy. It doesn't really do your side of the argument justice either. If you can't defend your beliefs against other peoples' ideas without reverting to simply saying "Your ideas are invalid because you're inhuman", that doesn't really say much about the strength of your argument.

A trend I've noticed is the vilification of compromise, e.g. when someone claims that the moderate position is automatically immoral because it enables those you disagree with.

Jon Ronson's TED Talk about this very thing is excellent and illuminating! "We dehumanize those we want to destroy, and we don't want to feel bad about it"

Maybe an unpopular opinion here but honestly yes, and it’s insane how acceptable it is in some places on Reddit. I mean this exact thing helped Trump win the election in the first place, but it seems to have been ramped up to 11 now. It doesn’t lead to any good political discourse, and only brings out the worst in both sides. I think Reddit forgets that extremism on both sides is bad, and since this place can be a huge echo chamber it only makes the problem worse over time.
In the historical context of Preston Brooks beating Charles Sumner on the floor of the US Senate, mere images just don't get me riled up. That may just be me.

You should see Theodore Geisel's (Dr Seuss) WWII era cartoons showing Japanese. Or was that just caricature of the enemy? Was Herblock's usual depiction of Jimmy Hoffa OK or not?

For me the problem is less the depiction of *the enemy* as the fact that far too many Americans view ***the opposition*** as the enemy.
I don’t really see how Trump supporter zombies is any different than NPCs or comparing liberals to virgins or whatever else conservatives like to depict liberals as that makes them out to be weak.

Edit: I guess neither is probably great for society but let’s not pretend both sides don’t dehumanize the opposition.
I saw this and was obviously annoyed. Just because I vote for one person you don’t agree with doesn’t mean I’m some brainless zombie. I think it’s more scary because online (and real life) that same person probably only interacts with people who share his views and further makes him believe that everyone that doesn’t believe in  left politics is a brainless zombie. These types of radicals are exactly what’s wrong with America. Left and right. The moment you say “this one side are just fucking idiots and need to die” is when you are what’s wrong with politics. Definitely talented artist but he should ashamed of himself
I wouldn’t say it “concerns me”. But I think it’s counterproductive, and sends the opposite message than what was intended. I look at that image and immediately imagine the artist themselves as being exactly what they’re depicting, except on the opposing side of the political spectrum.

Personally, I’ve been trying to separate myself from this kind of mindless identity bashing. I enjoy politics for the intellectual stimulation that allows you to really get into the weeds and analyze the nuance of complicated issues. Images like this, and identity politics in general, do none of that.
We see the beginning of the slippery slope of this by labeling those with different opinions as immoral, as opposed to just misguided, I think.

It creeps in from time to time – I think a lot of humans really like to believe they're "good guys," and it's easy to see yourself as a "good guy" when you're over-simplifying and generalizing the others as "bad" ones.

When you take this line of thinking and throw some extremism in there, next line of logic isn't that they're just "bad," but they need to be punished, censored, or contained.
