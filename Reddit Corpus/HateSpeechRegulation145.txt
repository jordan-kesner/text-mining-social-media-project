Title: AI social media post generator recommendations?

Post:
Anyone have a recommendation for an AI social media generator/manager that can automatically pull from a person’s photo gallery? 

This would be for starting up fitness and sports accounts on instagram, facebook, and twitter mostly. If the generator could pull automatically from a phone’s photo gallery and then create the caption from there that would be ideal. Preferably if it could automatically go through the photo gallery on a scheduled basis to create content.

If the generator is free, even better but not a deal breaker.

This is just for pulling photos from a phone’s gallery and creating the caption on a scheduled basis. All of it is real, since captions need to be edited. 

This isn’t photoshop.
