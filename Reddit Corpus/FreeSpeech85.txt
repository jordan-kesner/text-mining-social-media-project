Conservatives complain about the CCP then threaten to act like the CCP with state control over private Internet platforms. So on brand.
Boy these small government conservatives just love to increase the size of government. Social Media companies have the right to association and the right to free speech. If this ends up in court the law will be thrown out as unconstitutional. IMHO.
I'm amazed to see how this goes. 

First, Texas gets it's own power grid (that worked out so well). Is it now going to have "Texas-Net", the Texas-Only Internet?

And then websites can have people certify that they do not live in Texas before they join?

Will people then use VPNs to try to sneak onto "non-Texas" platforms?

Government control of the internet is so CCP-esque.
Freedom of speech for me!!! Not for thee!! Less government control for me!! Not for thee!!!  


I'm fundamentally curious on how they will enforce this. Are we going to have Texas ban Twitter and Facebook because of their "silencing of conservative voices"? Will Texas only be able to use Parler and their cousins? I mean slippery slope arguments are dumb, but if you were to tell me that Texas would be the closest to restricting internet access like Communist China, I would have laughed at you like you were crazy! But...here we are!! \*\*shrugs\*\*
i find that people have to work hard to get kicked off a tech platform

if people are so worrid about discrimination against conservatives why not just expand anti discrimation laws to protect political affiliation and ideology
