autistic people are the ones making content, because autistic love to talk about their interests and many autistic people are interested in autism.
Autistics are starting to realize a lot of us are smarter then average, that we’ve been ignored due to our social dysfunction and that we need to start to bring logic back to the rest of the world because it ain’t getting better without us. Some autistics are definitely delusional but we’ve realized most of our problems are just other ppl being offended or scared when they shouldn’t be. 

We have a disorder. Getting mad when we are to truthful, or use the wrong tone is a you problem.
