Title: CMV: Universities should end their endorsement and sponsorship of Fraternities and Sororities.

Post:
The recent scandal involving a [fraternity at the University of Oklahoma](http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/09/us/oklahoma-fraternity-chant/) triggered a train of thought about the value of University endorsed Greek life. I believe fraternities and sororities no longer provide enough value or goodwill to be worth the risk by the university. The university has so much to lose when a fraternity/sorority misbehaves, but very little to gain when things go right. 

Hazing, sexual assault, rape, alcohol irresponsibility, nepotism, insular behavior, creation of “us vs. them” mentality, and generally poor behavior are all reasons for the end of support by the university.

While I respect the charitable goals, it is becoming increasingly difficult to look past the [well documented issues](http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-83015352/). Additionally, if the members of the fraternity/sorority are altruistic in charitable goals, nothing is stopping them from organizing events or contributing to charity otherwise without the fraternity/sorority, or at minimum, without representing the University.  

Freedom of assembly is a common defense against my view on this. I concede that point 100%, but a counter argument to that is the assembly does not have to be University endorsed, sanctioned, and encouraged. Those wishing to be a member of a fraternity/sorority would still be free to do so, but not as official representatives of any university.

Another common rational for continuing their current existence is tradition. I am a huge supporter of tradition and believe it is crucial to preserving and enhancing culture of those participating. However, traditions can and do outlive their usefulness and should be eliminated or modified to adapt. Typically, modernization of views or opinions leaves the old traditions in poor light. To use an extreme example, the KKK used to be an official group at the [University of Illinois](http://archives.library.illinois.edu/features/kluklux.html).

Another common argument I have heard is that fraternities/sororities have higher GPA’s and graduate at higher rates. My response to that is would those students have done worse outside of the fraternity/sorority? More than likely, the answer is no. 

My main view is that Fraternities and Sororities are more a liability than an asset to universities. Members of Fraternities account for [~2% of the male population in America](http://www.uwgreek.com/frat/home.html). This is a very small percentage and is part of the reason nepotism is rampant towards members of Fraternities and Sororities. Additionally, other than current members, or past members of any fraternity/sorority, who would be worse off if they were to disappear from college campuses (this is assuming the charitable works were to continue due to the altruistic nature of members). 

EDIT: Many of the arguments against my view of universities ending endorsement and affiliation with Greek organizations have been something in the form of “if the university stopped overseeing them, the Greek organizations would potentially spiral out of control and become worse”.

That argument has done little to convince me that Universities should continue to support these organizations. In actuality, this argument may show there is a fundamental issue with the ideals or practices of a Greek Organization. I counter this argument with: if these organizations are meant for the betterment of society/campus/culture, then they should continue pursuit of that with or without university oversight. If their cause is noble, then what would they have to worry about with losing university endorsement?

EDIT 2: Limiting the scope of the discussion to social fraternities/sororities. Academic and Professional Greek organizations are not included in my view. 

CMV EDIT: /u/CasuallyMoral has typed the words that got through to me. Thank you to all that responded with thoughtful and reasonable answers. Universities ending affiliation with Greek Organizations is not the answer to the issues related to them and overall, universities have more to gain with them. I still believe the oversight needs to be stronger in some cases as /u/silliestsloth said.

The bogey man of the greek system is popular now because it's a better news story than cases of racism or sexual assault that just happen with groups of friends and colleges can punish the Greek system to pretend they're actually doing something. The Greek system isn't making up these problems, they exist all over campus. I wasn't a part of the Greek system and saw all sorts of problems. Getting rid of the Greek system is just pretending you fixed something, none of the drinking goes away. 

Socialization is extraordinary important. It's one of the big selling points of college and it's a big way people get jobs. The Greek system facilitates socializing and career/college networking. 
3 brief points. A universities main goal for all of it's students is for them to graduate and go on to be highly successful in whatever walk of life they choose. This serves 2 purposes; it boosts their statistics, making them a more attractive destination for prospective students, while simultaneously giving them a large network of successful alumni who will hopefully give back to the institution that helped them get to where they are (both through donations and hiring fresh graduates.) To that regard, the nepotism you despise is actually one of the biggest boons towards the college in the current state of the world; networking is a far more important commodity than you appear to be giving it credit. If a company has 2 fresh graduates for a potential hire; one with a 4.0, and active in a number of student organizations, or one who had a 3.8, but was in the CEO's fraternity, 100 times out of 100, the CEO will make sure his buddy gets the position. If you were to remove association with greeks, you close off access to those powerful networks to your students.

Secondly, you claim that the GPA/graduation rate would remain unchanged in a post greek campus, while offering no evidence outside of conjecture. The facts are starkly different. A vast majority of frats/sororities have minimum GPA's in the 2.5+ range. Many of them have probationary periods if you drop below a certain threshold, which comes with mandatory studying time and tutoring. They can draw upon all their resources to get help for their members that other students wouldn't have access to simple due to their network. Above all, the fraternity/sorority wants it's members to be leaders and be successful, because they in turn became valuable parts of the network themselves. What good is having someone who isn't serious about their schooling to the organization in the future?

Finally, like it or not, Greek Life is a huge part of campus life in many universities. Perhaps large state schools like Ohio State or Michigan can get by without them, but what of smaller or commuter schools? On those campuses, Greek life tends to drive the greater social scene, partially due to establishment, and partially due to the lack of a large base of students. Universities want an attractive social aspect for its students as well, and even if they can't actively endorse wild college partying lifestyles, they know in many cases the students would take themselves and their parents money elsewhere if the outlet didn't exist.

A bonus point because you've been good: What is the difference between a fraternity doing these negative things you speak of versus a student organization? Would you impose a similar ban on all of them for the idiocy of individual groups?
How do you think a university endorses a fraternity? 

Suppose my old university were to cut ties with my old fraternity, what do you think would be different? 

We owned our house out right. The university had no lien on it. We never utilized university property for anything. No offices or storage space. 

Sure, we recruited on campus. But if the university didn't endorse us, how would that prevent us from wearing recruiting shirts and talking to people about the fraternity? I could still talk about my fraternity and ask people to come to the house, right? Like any other off campus club. 

If anything, by withdrawing university endorsement, you would be making things worse. By being official, all the fraternities agreed to follow codes of conduct and other guidelines. So... We would be recruiting all the time. We would have hard liquor at our parties. We would have kegs. We would have more parties a year. 

What do you think that sending fraternities underground (so to say) would do exactly? 
I'm currently a senior in a fraternity at a very liberal school, so while I'm biased in favor of fraternities, I think the frats at my school are much less "fratty" than at others. Our frat doesn't haze, and all pledge events are optional. Usually about 1/2 to 3/4 of the pledges show up to any event, and we pride ourselves on not forcing anyone to do things that make them uncomfortable. From what I know about frats at other schools, that makes us somewhat unique. 

We take sexual assault seriously (our last president especially made a big effort to make sure we were a safe fraternity), and we try to be a diverse group of guys. We drink quite a bit and occasionally get a too rowdy but, for the most part, I think we are pretty responsible. 

College students want to go to parties with alcohol and will find a way to do it regardless of whether fraternities exist or not. Fraternities *can* be great at meeting that desire. Based on my experience, we've haven't had a negative impact on the school. I would argue we've only been a social good. But I agree with you that many (maybe most) are not positive influences. 

I never thought I would join a frat, but I was convinced by the conduct and reputation of my fraternity to join. I haven't stopped taking my academics seriously (I'm phi beta kappa, along with several other members of the frat), nor have I become a misogynist. I get to hang out with a great group of guys many of whom I wouldn't have met without the fraternity. 

I do think that we should police frats much more, but I can personally attest to the existence of "good" fraternities. I would be upset if my fraternity were banned based on the perception that all fraternities are bad. 
> Hazing, sexual assault, rape, alcohol irresponsibility, nepotism, insular behavior, creation of “us vs. them” mentality, and generally poor behavior are all reasons for the end of support by the university.

Isn't this just as prevalent in college sports? Should they end those next?
When the university sponsores fraternities and sororities it can exercise control over them.

If universities cut greek organizations loose, the organizations will remain, but will now be even less controlled.

How would that be any better?
>Another common argument I have heard is that fraternities/sororities have higher GPA’s and graduate at higher rates. My response to that is would those students have done worse outside of the fraternity/sorority? More than likely, the answer is no.

You could say the same about their problems. In my experience, fraternities/sororities tend to magnify the good and bad traits the people involved share in common, but those good or bad qualities don't magically appear out of nowhere. They are qualities that already exist in the student population. Getting rid of fraternities/sororities only sweeps the problems under the rug, it doesn't do anything to solve them.
The way fraternities are represented in the media makes them seem like they are the root cause of typical college vices of drinking, drugs, partying and the other things mentioned.  This is not true, the problems of college students come from the students, they don't suddenly appear because they form an official group.  


Parties, drinking, sexual assault etc. would not stop if fraternities were abolished.  These behaviors would simply manifest in other ways.  People would simply get drunk, do drugs and get in trouble in general at other, non-greek houses.  Why does it matter then?  As a fraternity brother, I can tell you that all brothers in a house have a vested interest in keeping things under control.  Some guy acting creepy?  Throw him out.  Someone drank way too much?  Call an ambulance.  People fighting?  Break it up.  Everyone works to keep things in order and under control because we know that if shit goes down, we lose our charter.  

It's true that colleges face a lot of issues stemming from kids barely out of their teens getting a rush of newfound freedom.  But although Greek organizations might be a convenient boogeyman for all these problems, they wont go away by abolishing the system.  It's far preferable to keep college rowdiness in the greek environment, where it can be monitored and kept in check by the university.
I don't have the best POV to argue from since the college I went to didn't affiliate with fraternities or sororities.  People lived in dorms, or they lived off-campus.  

It's not like the kind of secret society mentality, the hazing, and the heavy partying didn't happen, it still happened, just not in "Greek houses".

You argue that all the good stuff fraternities/sororities do, they could do without being a fraternity/sorority.  It goes exactly the same for all the bad stuff.  

But I think the real x-factor you aren't considering is the alumni.  Colleges are very dependent on alum giving, and alums whose fond memories of their college experience were focused on a particular fraternity or sorority that they were part of are not going to be happy about the college kicking that group out without a good reason.  Think of this as the "tradition" thing, except with actual dollars backing it.  

Honestly, fraternities and sororities are just clubs and the idea of not allowing this particular type of club is just busting up traditions for no reason.  *My* alma mater doesn't have that problem because they just haven't had this tradition.  
Am I right in thinking that these a peculiarly North American phenomenon? Never came across anything like them in UK universities. Do they exist elsewhere?
