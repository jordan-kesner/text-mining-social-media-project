Title: CMV: "I disapprove of what you have to say, but I will fight for your right to say it", is a good principle for society.

Post:
I am relative purist when I comes to free speech. Whilst I accept there are some limitations, I think I these are fringe cases (violence, libel).

I think broadly society should have a mutually understood principle that even if you disagree or disapprove of someone's speech, they have the right to say it.

This includes supposed 'misinformation' and 'hate speech'.

As John Stuart Mill makes clear in On Liberty "he who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that", and "“If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.”

Hate speech is a poorly worded and fascial set of legislation in the UK that can be used to prosecute anyone (including a young girl posting lyrics to a rap song and many teaching his dog to nazi salute as a joke - both of which have been arrested and prosecuted, though the former was released on appeal).

Ultimately a functioning society requires us to appreciate others views and allow them the space to air their beliefs, even if we believe they are wrong.

Just to confirm, we are talking about legislating speech, not forcing people to give platform to others?

If someone keeps throwing racial slurs and I decide to no longer invite them to my board game night, I’m not violating their right to free speech.

The right to free speech is indissociable from the right of association, and the right of association includes the right of non-association.

Being socially shunned, dumped, uninvited or not dated because of opinions other people find reprehensible doesn’t stop someone from having and expressing those opinions.

Now, where it gets more tricky, if that same person is continuously spouting bigotry at work and it disrupt the colleagues.  If the manager decides to fire them because the employee turnover they’re causing is too costly, is that a violation of free speech?

And, finally, where is the line between free speech and harassment? Defamation?
‘I will also fight for the right of others to say that you are wrong. ‘ is a nice addendum. Just because you can say it does not mean others cannot respond with their own statements.
> I am relative purist when I comes to free speech. Whilst I accept there are some limitations, I think I these are fringe cases (violence, libel).

By violence do you only include actual, immediate threats, or also generalized incitements?

To take a more extreme example; is there any justification for protecting speech like "All XYZ people deserve to be rounded up and shot"? What does society have to gain from protecting it?
As you say, there must be limits.  Why are you drawing the line at libel?  Why is that unacceptable speech, but disinformation isn't?  After all, isn't libel just specifically targeted disinformation?
>I am relative purist when I comes to free speech. Whilst I accept there are some limitations, I think I these are fringe cases (violence, libel)

I mean, then you're not *really* a purist. These are mainly what 99% of people who want *some* restrictions on free speech want.

Many proponents of hate speech laws define "hate speech" as speech that incites violence toward a particular group.

And indeed, John Stuart Mill himself argues that such speech should not be allowed (the corn dealer example, if you're familiar with it).
Would you fight for my right to spread misinformation that could directly or indirectly harm you in some way? 

Let's use a real example that has happened in Florida. 

You are a housing developer, your income and wealth depends on your ability to build new homes. 

I am a politician that is being bribed by your competitor. I push for some poorly done, extremely biased research that leads to a report that convinces regulators that you should not get the permits you need for your next big project. 

You've already invested millions in your project and now it's all wasted. 

Are you fighting for my right to spread misinformation now?
So what do you think about when hate speech directly leads to increasing political discrimination up to a genocide against a minority group? The Nazis used misinformation and propaganda to incredible effect in WWII, but even in the modern era there was a genocide a few years back in [Myanmar that was directly linked to hate speech being spread on Facebook](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/).
"The right to say it" does not mean the right to say it anywhere anytime with no consequences whatsoever. You can fight for the *right of a person to say anything without being prosecuted by the government*. But if an employee of a company says something that can cause big losses to the company, the company can and maybe should fire that employee and that would not be in violation of the person's rights.

>This includes supposed 'misinformation'

If you tell people that you are a doctor and that drinking urine cures cancer or that HIV doesn't exist and there's no need for protection during sex then you should bear the consequences of that if people rely on your misinformation and die.
