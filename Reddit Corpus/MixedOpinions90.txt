Title: State of the Subreddit Address, New Moderators, Introductions/Free Talk, General Housekeeping [and more?]

Post:
Happy Wednesday, everyone!

I'm dropping a stickied (meta) thread for a few reasons today and hoping to get some serious community engagement on an idea I had *several* months ago and never bothered to execute on, as well as provide some news and updates on the state of the subreddit. Let's go on a journey!

## New Moderators

I'd like to formally welcome our newest moderators to our team: /u/Dan_G, /u/Gerfervonbob, /u/abrupte, /u/scrambledhelix, and /u/sheffieldandwaveland. I'm sure you'll recognize most (if not all) of these names from being very active commenters and engaged members of our community dedicated to the free exchange of ideas and our subreddit's mantra, regardless of their political lean. These guys have been live for about a month now and are doing some spectacular work from streamlining our internal moderation workflows (props to /u/abrupte and /u/Gerfervonbob) to strong community involvement (special shout-outs to /u/Dan_G and /u/sheffieldandwaveland) to... being awake at useful times and being a kickass arbiter in general (/u/scrabledhelix).

Also /u/Ignose is back but whatever.

We received *overwhelming* interest from the community (seriously- I had to build out a spreadsheet, it was... a lot) in the new mod roles when we put feelers out a month ago and I'd like to personally thank everyone that applied- just like job applications we *are* keeping those inquiries on file and as we add more to the staff we'll be pulling from that existing pool (as well as new applicants when we next request) for the next team.

I'll let these guys do their own introductions below and circle back to this in a sec.

## 50,000 Subscriber Milestone

I know, right?! We broke 50k recently and had surprisingly little fanfare. I speak for the entire moderation team when I issue a heartfelt thank you to our users that make this place one of the few, if not the only, environments on the internet wherein open political discourse is welcomed, encouraged, and (sometimes) gently nudged along toward the goal of civility and sensibility. Dare I say there's really no place like /r/moderatepolitics. Cheers to that, and here's to 50,000 more!

## Housekeeping

Yeah- I can't let one of these go by without some gentle reminders. First- review our sidebar. Seriously. It's really short. Second- there's been a fair amount of inquiry lately surrounding some moderation decisions and I *love* when the community asks questions- as it allows us to modify and perfect our moderation strategy; but a lot of the less nuanced questions of our 'law' can be summarized really nicely in one sentence: "Don't be a dick, aim for the highest form of the argument- not the most pithy or quotable, make your argument about *content* instead of *character*, and remember the human on the other side of the discussion." You'd be *amazed* what you can get away with, how elevated the conversation becomes, and how much it improves our environment when you hold fast to those tenets.

As always, our moderation team can be best reached via [Discord](https://discord.gg/fHNFKuB), or via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmoderatepolitics) with *any* questions, inquiries, suggestions, or (speaking of discord) if you just want to hang out and shoot the shit with our mods, regular users, lurkers, gaming nerds, and have some (usually) very insightful conversations. Recent discussions have pivoted around the best way to make collard greens, Warhammer, the benefits and detractions of UBI, the merits of various anime shows, 'how many colors are there, really?', 'is St Louis *really* that dangerous?', American exceptionalism, whether socialists are cool, and tons of other incredibly engaging political (and non-political) discussions. 

Or you can wait until around 11PM EST and read my drunken ramblings or see /u/ubmt1861 and I talk about weird stuff.

## Introductions & Free Talk

In that vein we finally circle around to my 30,000ft point of this post: as we enter the election season in full force, despite the brave new world that is COVID-19 life, I felt it'd be a great idea for us to take the opportunity as a community to do something we normally try to avoid- and get personal. Such is to say I've tapped a few of our moderators (and myself) to get this kicked off, but I'd love for everyone- mods, users, lurkers coming out of the woodwork- to get engaged and tell us a little about yourself. Who are you? What do you do? What brought you to r/moderatepolitics? What would you say guides your political compass? How has COVID changed your life? What are you up to today? What's on your mind lately? Have any thoughts about the subreddit? Want to evangelize a new podcast or a dank meme you came across? What have you been watching on TV (the same shit as everyone, I imagine, since there's nothing new)? Make any good food recently? See a funny YouTube video? Let's dig in!

I encourage folks to keep it civil; obviously our rules will still be in effect, but I'd love it if we could get beyond the usernames and upvotes and downvotes and divisive politics and maybe take some time to get to know each other as people and reflect on and explore the individuals that make this subreddit what we all love. If you come across this post in a few days, add your bit to the mix too! I think we'd all love to have some input and engagement from everyone, regardless of your activity- submit a top-level post with whomever you are and what's on your mind!

As always- cheers, my friends!

Hi, I'm Dan_G and I'm a ... conservatarian... ish. Labels are harder than ever to apply, it seems like. I work in IT as a systems admin by day and read sci-fi and fantasy or play strategy games by night. I think my second most commonly commented-in sub after this one is probably r/dresdenfiles. (goddamn cliffhangers.)

I honestly don't remember when I found this sub, but I lurked for a long time before I started to participate, thinking this might actually be the unicorn, the space where you could talk politics with people who actually disagree with you and not have it devolve into screaming and name-calling. So far, it mostly has been! I started to participate, eventually joined the discord and hung out there for a few months before eventually having this whole mod thing come up.

I'll drop in some recommended political or political-adjacent podcasts since I end up listening to those a lot during the day while at work - I generally don't listen to every episode (except for TFC, which I never miss) but will grab ones that look interesting: 

* The Fifth Column
* Advisory Opinions
* Blocked and Reported
* Mad Dogs and Englishmen
* Uncommon Knowledge
* Quillette
* FiveThirtyEight Politics
* Against the Grain
* Law Talk
* SCOTUStalk and SCOTUSblog
So I thought I’d take a stab at introducing myself properly and show y’all how *not* to do it.

First, feel free to come call me out for bad judgment on the Discord channel. Constructive criticism is always appreciated, I’m normally too far up my own ass to notice if I’ve crossed a line somewhere and learning as I go. Unlike the other mods my timezone is CEST, or UTC+2:00 for any fellow nerds out there, so you might have to wait until I’m awake again at 2am EST for a response. 

r/MP has been a home for me on Reddit for a couple years now, because ~~I’m a masochist by nature~~ I like to know what people’s ideas are, especially anyone I disagree with, but just airing opinions can get heated. Modpol’s focus may not always reduce the heat but everyone gets a fair shake here — and that’s all I nope to help keep going. 

Most people (panda included) paint me as one of the lefty mods, but I like to *believe* I’m at the middle-bottom of the 2D political compass, because as we all know, most lefties are in denial about their radical predilections, and far be it for me to claim otherwise. Analytic philosophy is my jam and background, so I strive to be the nitpickiest mod you’ll ever meet, but if you’re willing to chase me on it I do promise to admit when I’m wrong, and look forward to anyone who can prove it.

In closing, I like anime, graphic novels and the history of comics, unix, philosophy, blacksmithing, comparative religion, arguing about politics, and drinking. Oh, and I live in Germany. For over 13 years now, watching the US devolve into an tribal anarchosocialist-libertarian cesspit while I sip cocktails and judge y’all from the other side of the pond. 

But always with love ❤️
Hey all! abrupte here, new addition to the mod team. Politically, I'm firmly to the left, despite that I try (really hard) to keep an open mind and find myself agreeing with some of the right-leaning folks around here more often than not. Many times we want the same thing, we just differ on how we want to get there.

I found this sub shortly after the 2016 election. Like many of you around here that election shook me to my core. It made me realize that I had no idea what was truly happening in America and maybe, just maybe, I had been living in an echochamber of thought and news. Moderate Politics was both a breath of fresh air and a tough pill to swallow. It offered a spectrum of political opinions while encouraging civil discussion, but it also forced me to read and sometimes agree with opinions and politics that I really didn't want to agree with (damn you logic and well thought out debate!). It's most of the reason why I love this sub and why, against my better judgement, I joined the mod team.

Outside of Reddit I'm a dad, software and data engineer, avid reader, sci-fi/fantasy nerd, runner, biker, hiker, and, in my humble opinion, an all around decent dude.

> What am I reading?

I've been on a Haruki Murakami kick lately and loving every weird minute of it.

> What am I watching?

Don't judge. I'm currently consuming all of the CW DC Shows (Arrow, Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow) in simultaneous order. It's garbage, mindless TV, but it's comforting and easy to watch.

> What am I doing during COVID-19?

Working from home, juggling work and family life, running more than I have in years, and growing a mustache and mullet.

Hope everyone is healthy and keeping safe out there. <3
Hi everyone. I'll try to keep this short and sweet. Would have posted here earlier but u/agentpanda didn't wait for me to be awake. Like dude, its only 4 pm. Freaking rude but I digress. 

As my flair indicates I am a college student/conservative. When I'm not doing last-minute course work I like to argue with users here, watch sports, and play some video games. Currently waiting for u/recipr0c1ty to step down so I can turn this place into a fantasy football sub.

I strongly lean towards the right side of the aisle but diverge on some important issues. I feel the strongest about the 2nd amendment and immigration. If anyone ever wants to get bogged down in a 3-hour "debate" about these two issues just ping me. 

If you ever feel I've made some bad calls that's alright... I have liked Nickelback and U2 for years now. Bad judgment is baked into my character. Thankfully, we have a lot of great mods here to hold each other accountable. If you ever have any questions head over to the discord or mod mail. We will gladly review anything you feel was incorrectly handled.
Hello! I’m Chrome, I’m a 24-year-old Canadian whose been lurking around here for a couple months. I was raised in a conservative, Christian family and left the religion a few years ago. Since then I’ve been trying to find my beliefs outside of religion. 

I found this sub during the beginning of the protests because I was trying to find a place where people were having good talks without emotions running insanely high. This place felt like the calm in the storm, as even the online knitting community I was part of was constantly full of emotionally-charged posts. I’m always wary of appeals to emotion because that was the kind of religious manipulation I grew up with in the church. 

In my spare time I do a lot of knitting and watching YouTube videos about fashion and clothing design. I do a lot of reading, too, though I’m currently trying to decide what to read next!

I came to this sub maybe a year ago. During the Democratic primaries. Although I mostly agreed with sentiments I would see in r/politics I usually like to find opposing views. I tried looking at r/conservative but found no room for dialog. Found this and I saw potential. It has mostly met my needs. I was much more active while the Democratic primary was in full swing. After impeachment and when dem-tron formed I backed off.

I still lurk, I find I mostly want to understand other people and the issues instead of voicing my opinion. I still chime in here and there. Most of the topics that come up lately are bit too clickbaity for me to want to participate in. I often find that even those posts lead to some insightful conversation so I do appreciate them.

I kind of hope that we can stop the sides/teams mentality. Elected officials claim to be of a certain party. No need for voters to pledge allegiance to either. 

A recommended youtube channel would be [Knowing Better](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8XjmAEDVZSCQjI150cb4QA). I won't claim that his videos are 100% unbiased or accurate but they are worthwhile watching. He does a good job of viewing topics from multiple angles and cutting through the noise.

If you are a fan of De La Soul then I would bet we would get along.
Hello everyone, I'm swamped working, so I don't have much time to post, but I wanted to add my introduction before this thread gets too stale.

I work as a systems engineer and graphic designer. I'm a US Marine Corps veteran from 2009-2013 with two combat deployments to Afghanistan (3/5 & 2/5, if you're curious). My hobbies these days are mostly in pc gaming, dabbling in game development, and military history. 

I'll be honest; I have no idea where I sit politically anymore. In the past, I've identified as Republican, but I haven't for a long while. I hold strong "left" & "right" views, but I very much dislike blind adherence to ideology. I keep my opinions based on what I think is right and pragmatic so it can go both ways. I feel I'm willing to change my position on things if there is a better argument. I'd say the few things I hold to be absolute is, the rule of law without authoritarianism, equality under the law, and free and open societies. 

I think that this subreddit and places like it are critical to the workings of democracy and civil society in a time where the internet facilitates echo chambers and tribalism.  I became a mod to help maintain this subreddit and community. Thanks to everyone for a great community!
> Who are you? 

I'm [Resvrgam](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/resurgam). I'm a fan of camping, hiking, sailing, disc golf, and the occasional glass of scotch. I'm a Patriots fan living in NJ, so that's a bit rough. I also have an unhealthy obsession with Dungeons & Dragons. I'm basically a walking poster child for white privilege.

> What do you do? 

I've spent the better part of a decade in IT/Information Security.

> What brought you to r/moderatepolitics? 

A distaste for those who lack nuanced discussion and a desire to find a community that shared those sentiments. I've stayed because of the rockin Discord channel. Truthfully, I forget how I first heard of /r/MP, but it may have been arund the time /r/NeutralNews went on hiatus.

> What would you say guides your political compass? 

I'm mostly still figuring that out. I lean fairly Libertarian, and I'll defend Trump when his actions (and not words) warrant it. I'm a big fan of following the Supreme Court thanks to the educated nuance they add to any major case. As for posting on this sub, when in doubt, I typically just agree with whatever /u/poundfoolishhh has said.

> How has COVID changed your life? 

I justified buying a new computer, dual monitors, desk, and webcam. I've saved a ton due to a lack of happy hours and travel. The run on guns sparked by COVID means I have to wait forever for the firearm I want. I'm sure I'm a slightly pastier shade than normal thanks to all the time spent indoors.

> What are you up to today? 

Working, and trying to stay cool. It's a hot one, and the humidity is not helping.

> Have any thoughts about the subreddit? 

One of my favorite communities on Reddit. I'd love to see more discussion of specific policies rather than whatever scandal is currently rocking US politics. Anything that can remove some of the identity politics from the discussion and focus on the specifics. Maybe give themed posts or post series a shot?

> What have you been watching on TV (the same shit as everyone, I imagine, since there's nothing new)? 

The behind-the-scenes series for both The Mandalorian and Frozen 2 (both on Disney+) are absolutely amazing. Frozen 2 gives a great look at current animation processes by following the production through its final year of development. The Mandalorian one has themed episodes, some diving deep into the truly groundbreaking technology they created that is heavily influenced by digital animation. 

> Want to evangelize a new podcast or a dank meme you came across?

Does the /r/MP Discord count? It's basically an endless stream of fascinating topics, interspersed with dank memes.
>Who are you?

I'm ... not batman?

>What do you do?

I'm self-employed in the aviation and insurance industries.

>What brought you to [r/moderatepolitics](https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/)?

Silly as it sounds, I wanted to discuss issues with people who make an effort to know what they're talking about. I wanted to talk to people who would hear me out instead of simply labeling me as "on the other team" and try to ridicule me into submission.

>What would you say guides your political compass?

I don't believe any American wakes up in the morning with the intent to ruin America today. I believe we all want the same things: A nation that is safe, prosperous and free. We just don't agree on what those words mean or how to get there. I believe this is true of Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi and my fellow r/moderatepolitics subscribers, too. Though I may not agree with their plan or how the execute it, they do what they do for a reason. Because nobody is wrong 100% of the time, it's definitely worth knowing and understanding that perspective, even if I disagree with the conclusions.

>How has COVID changed your life?

I miss good, fresh, hot food. We have never been a family that's big on home cooking, so we're having to adjust to doing a lot more of that.

>What are you up to today?

Mostly work, which means Reddit. 

>What's on your mind lately?

I'm generally pro-BLM and have no problems with protests, but I feel like it's just gone too far. I'm sorry George Floyd died. He absolutely shouldn't have and he's one of too many who've died like that. But at the same time, I don't hate the police and I think we should back off the protesting, the riots and the violence and give the police a chance to clean their own house. The message has been sent and received. From this moment onward, more will be accomplished by accountability and at the voting booth than with anarchy. 

Also, I'm uneasy. I'm a straight, white male in a world that's lately been telling me that everything I ever came from is bad. I often feel like modern history's villain for things that I haven't even done. I admit that sometimes I feel reactionary and think things like: *You think I'm the bad guy? If it's my team versus your team and I can't talk you out of it, then at least I'm going to win. If I can't have your friendship, I'll settle for your respect. If you won't give me that, I'll take your fear.* (My inner dialog has a flair for the dramatic.) 

>Have any thoughts about the subreddit?

Yes.

>Want to evangelize a new podcast or a dank meme you came across?

No.

>What have you been watching on TV (the same shit as everyone, I imagine, since there's nothing new)? 

My daughter and I have started Season 1 of Bob's Burgers and we hit a couple or three episodes a night. I'm also re-watching 30 Rock, which was one of my all-time favorite shows and I'm enjoying it immensely. 

>Make any good food recently?

Yes.

>See a funny YouTube video? 

Yes.
Hey folks!

I'm agentpanda- I've been a moderator here in r/moderatepolitics for several months now and a user for quite a lot longer. By day I'm the director of project management in a midsized software firm, and a former lawyer-turned-tech-bro as of 2008-ish when the recession made my shiny new JD a really expensive piece of paper. My wife is political editor for a national paper and a political operative with the DNC in election years, I'm a British-American dual citizen and a great lover of federalism! 

As I'm sure plenty of you have gleaned by now I politically identify as a moderate Republican most days of the week, and I'm happy to expand on any of my positions if anyone likes, just smash that 'reply' button!

In my downtime I'm an avid runner, walking soother of my wife's white guilt (kidding... but not really), a very prolific home cook, huge wine nerd, and a pretty massive computer dork. Oh, and I love firearms but everyone knows that about me already. What would you all like to know about me?

edit: /u/Ignose is right! I'm a huge car lover- I've been restoring Corvettes since I was a kid with my dad (he's the American side of my Britsh-American, no surprise) and I love a good track day in my M4. Looking forward to my new house build being complete so the wife and I can relocate to a place with a proper garage and I can get my hands back into a restoration.
