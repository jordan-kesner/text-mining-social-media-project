>The issue has taken on more urgency as German politicians worry that proliferating fake news and racist content, particularly about migrants, could sway public opinion in the run-up to a national election on 24 September.

That's pretty telling.
Years down the road a truly hateful politician will use these laws as an excuse to remove any content they disagree with, including dissent against their leadership, and the rest of the world will be wondering how it got approved in the first place.

Read your damn history books people. Government's with unrestrained censorship powers never end up well. I don't care if you think Merkel and her administration is the 2nd Coming of Jesus Christ, one day there **will** be someone you don't like in power and they **will** use this power to silence your dissent.
I think we all know they are going to be removing everything and anything even remotely not in line with their rules, because why would they pay someone to check when they can just put it out of sight and out of mind immediately?
Wait!!! I thought Germany was the leader of the free world now!? Various brands of egalitarian redditors told me so!! Was I taken on a ruse cruise!? Or are they actually ok with censorship? 
This coming immediately after [Canada courts saying their orders apply worldwide](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/28/15888408/canada-supreme-court-google-block-search-results-equustek-datalink) it is certain the Germans will make the same demands.

This quickly leads to the internet not expanding free speech, but rather the internet having the "free speech" policy of the most regressive nation big enough that companies want to do business in, as the only way to avoid such rulings is to have no business dealings in that country *and* for the major corporate officeholders and board to avoid travelling into, as it can lead to arrests.

That country is most likely Germany.

This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jun/30/germany-approves-plans-to-fine-social-media-firms-up-to-50m) reduced by 86%. (I'm a bot)

> Social media companies face fines of up to &euro;50m if they persistently fail to remove illegal content from their sites under a new law passed in Germany.

> Aside from the hefty fine for companies, the law also provides for fines of up to &euro;5m for the person each company designates to deal with the complaints procedure if it doesn&#039;t meet requirements.

> The nationalist Alternative for Germany party, which has frequently been accused of whipping up sentiments against immigrants and minorities, said it is considering challenging the law in Germany&#039;s highest court.
