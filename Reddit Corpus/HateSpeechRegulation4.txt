It's 2023.... No body cares about hashtags.. if you do, then good luck. Because hashtags has no value anymore. Instagram is able to understand the content without the hashtags. You can test... Post something with 10 hashtags and without any hashtag. Same result.

Moseri himself said that hashtags are not relevant at all. That said, goodbye and downvote.
