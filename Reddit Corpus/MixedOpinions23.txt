Title: Cmv: I do not believe men can be physically abused by a woman

Post:
New people stroll to the bottom please before reading the Og post or whining in the comments, the last edit explains everything.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know my account is usually more wholesome but I cannot get this out of my mind, don't attack me yet let me explain but before I explain why I hold such a belief I'll start by saying.

* Yes, I know it is possible to do. Anyone with 2 hands and legs can hit/kick someone.
* No, I'm not speaking about children. I'd say child abuse if I meant "Women cant harm male kids"
* Yes I know I'm an asshole for holding this belief, but that's why I'm here to get that changed.
* I will try to answer questions about my view as soon as I see them.
* I mean with their hands or legs, yes I know you can be physically assaulted with a weapon
* Yes, I know my grammar is shit.
* Yes, I believe if a guy is being physically abused he should leave if he feels like it.
* Yes, I'm aware I ask weird questions and believe weird things.

Now onto why, if I missed a "Prestatement" I'll edit more in.

Alright, I already know that biology-wise men tend to be stronger. However anytime I get online every time I get some random Reddit text-to-speech bot asking

"Woman, are men THAT much stronger than you?" And the replies will always be some story like "I got into a fight with my 5 yr old son and he threw me out the window."

Of course, I don't believe all those stories are real but I do hold the belief there is some major difference in strength.

Because of that....how is it possible to be physically abused (in a way that matters) by someone THAT much weaker than you?

I mean "Just fight back" aside if someone weaker than me hit me; the only thing that would hurt is my feelings. In a relationship, if she is really hurting someone's feelings that much why wouldn't they just leave her?

It is not like there's a threat of "Oh she's gonna kill me if I leave" there.

If there

* no threat
* no actual harm is being done

then there's

* no reason you're scared to leave
* no reason you cannot fight back .(outside of fear of arrest)
* high chance there 0 after effects (like trauma)

and if those two are the case then how are you being physically abused in a way that matters?

\[(A way that matters: are you're scared to leave, you cannot fight back and real harm is being done to you (physically) to ME if there's not abuse being done in a way that matters I tend to care less or not at all\]

Ok, I think I covered everything. Please change my opinion, as someone with a brother i WANT to care but right now? I just don't, I don't see it as possible. it's on the same level as telling your friend to stop being dumb but they refuse, you just stop caring.

==================================================================

Edit:  Ok so I was able to grant only ONE delta as really only ONE person was actually listening

* I'm speaking about JUST PHYSICAL ABUSE
* I'm NOT saying women cant be abusive at all
* NO I DO NOT think physical abuse is now ok
* YES i'm aware this is a bad opinion to have. you'd know that IF YOU READ THE POST
* i already defined what "in a way that matters means" READ IT
* im the one who quantify it because I HOLD THE OPINION i'm not trying to get YOU to convert i'm trying to help you understand how i think

i really CANNOT be any clearer. i hope this helps but the amount of people who didnt read are killing me

=================================================================

EDIT 2: alright people calm your horses, my opinion was changed, thank you, yes the conversation is still open but you dont need to be so defensive anymore.

since the convo is most likely still going to happen i'd like to bring up that

* a lot of you just aren't reading the post
* I said PHYSICAL abuse not just abuse in general
* Outliers are Outliers
* Mainly people spoke on the leave portion and not the actual physical aspect which is fine but now everyone is repeating themselves
* if you just wanna insult you could just inbox me as i want to make this thread a clear discussion about the topic. but feel free to insult if you add a point to it.
* Thank you (everyone who helped) for actually changing my opinion, I really appreciate it! thank you so much and I'll probably be back with another opinion about whatever.
* i'll answer nonrepetitive comment when i can
* although i said this 1000 times, weapons take out the physical strength aspect that my post was about so i didnt inculde those instances, i'm not saying that isnt abuse i'm saying it isnt the topic
* Guys i already know that its a bad opinion, this just getting repetitive

==========================================================================

EDIT 3" probably the last edit

* no i'm not adding a TLDR, people are already confused when i've been this clear, to the point where they arent reading the title, they won't read a TLDR or will still misunderstand my words
* I do take personal stories but please if they bring up bad memories don't waste it on a Reddit post
* just DM me the insults, unless you have an actual point with it, then go off. if you don't then most likely i wont respond.
* no i'm not deleting this, it won't help me or others
* N O I am not going to just "go to a different sub" this sub is great, with amazing people and I am here to get my view changed. That's the point of this sub. no matter how bad the  opinion is you're supposed to change it, (or at least try) which you did with me so,

==================================================================

Edit 4(shocker, but fr this is the last one, turns out i have to add spaces between bullet points because some of you are blind??) for the new people

* my opinion was already changed. it is the reverse now that I have been enlightened by people with actual points, you can still address the og post as i am open to discussing.

&#x200B;

* If you're confused on the "point" of my post, i was speaking in general terms but regardless you're allowed to bring up that my og post was speaking in absolutes i just probably won't reply.

&#x200B;

* please do not reinforce my point, some of you are unironically/indirectly agreeing and that's weird. you can avoid this by actually reading my post. I'll point out when you have/how.
   * Comparing an adult woman's strength to an 8 -12 yr old boy's is how i got to this opinion. stop doing that.
      * Saying "well all men WOULD win a fight against a woman" is weird and how i got to this opinion. stop doing that.

&#x200B;

* my central point was that "if a woman is weaker than a man how can she physically abuse him without a weapon?"

&#x200B;

* If you cannot argue against my central point, don't waste time by whining about "this is impossible to do" or "you redefined abuse" i didn't do that, but if you're having problems look at the easier points.

&#x200B;

* if it is too long just read the bullet points.  and the "in a way that matters section" and you'll get it.(at least you should be able too)

&#x200B;

* stop asking if I am trolling: why would i waste mines and everyone else time?? why come to get my view changed if it was alll a big joke? why would i want to do something this dumb in front of over 12k people if i was just joking?? you know how much karma was ate through on this post alone? i can't even repost on this sub if i wanted to.

&#x200B;

* i already know physical abuse doesn't start there, BUT that's what i am looking at. that is the only aspect.

&#x200B;

* "Bad opinion" Do you want a cookie or gold star? i already know that. this could be a dm

&#x200B;

* if you're confused, ask me to explain, I will be happy to. do not just whine about how confused you are

&#x200B;

* don't respond to really old messages I won't see them, just make your own

&#x200B;

* read. the. replies. or don't but I will tell you if you should or not.

&#x200B;

* other people got deltas, you can too

&#x200B;

* stop asking me why i won't include weapons, they take out the physical strength aspect of it.

&#x200B;

* Holy fuck stop asking why i excluded weapons, i explain this LITERALLY ONE BULLET POINT ABOVE THIS ONE. \^\^\^\^\^\^\^  stop whining about "well now its not realistic" because you saying this tells me that you don't believe women can physically abuse men without a weapon.

&#x200B;

* "Why is your opinion like that and not like this!!!" IT just was. there most likely isnt an answer to your question, it just was, it was fully planned out, and thought out opinion that i spent decades gathering info for i just thought about it, couldn't shake it out my mind, then i was like "well i know somewhere that could help

&#x200B;

* "Why are you asking Reddit for" that is the point of this sub stop whining about how I use it

&#x200B;

* "Your first bullet point answers your question" no it doesn't, the first bullet point was to address that i already KNOW THE LITERAL DEFINITION, I am aware of the literal definition. stop going "well I stopped reading" Clearly you did. also, i am not giving you a delta nor does it change anything if you just point out what the literal definition is.

&#x200B;

* "but but but what if the guy is this that and this"  or "what is she does this and that to him to weaken him first" same as the weapons argument. I really do not want to get hyper-specific but you seem to be actually brain-dead if I don't spell that out.

&#x200B;

* "well the post is too long!" i am not adding a TLDR, read the post or don't comment.

This has to be the most incoherent argument I’ve ever seen… the definition of physical abuse is 

> any intentional act causing injury, trauma, bodily harm or other physical suffering to another person or animal by way of bodily contact.

By definition that is bullet point 1. There are many examples of wives killing husbands or badly mutilating or maiming them. By your view males can’t abuse females either. Why dont the females just leave? They must be stupid. Just stop getting hit “in a way that matters”
>I do hold the belief there is some major difference in strength.

>Because of that....how is it possible to be physically abused

Abuse has absolutely *nothing* to do with fighting back.

E.g., if my wife hit me I could easily stop her and subdue her. We'll never been in that scenario, but even if I stopped her - she abused me. Her *initial action* would have been the abuse.

Anything that happens after that is a consequence of that abuse. But it doesn't remove it. And just because I'm physically capable of preventing her from physically harming me - doesn't mean she isn't capable of abusing me.
Male victim of domestic assault by his girlfriend here.
Yes you absolutely can be abused, snd not just physically. For one most men are taught from early childhood not to hit a woman, so defending yourself is very problematic, as most people will assume you’re the real abuser. My partner put me in the yhe hospital for 4 days, and even after she got arrested and confessed to all of it, I still lost more than a few friends that belived I was the abuser and she was defending herself.

For two, being strong does not make you invulnerable to harm. Humans are much more fragile than we like to think, and it does not take much to end a life. A 3 inch pocket knife can do irreparable damage with very little more than a small child’s strength. 

For three, in a domestic situation, your abuser is someone you trust and share some of your most intimate moments with. I can’t even really sleep in a bed with another person sometimes, and it’s been a very real source of frustration in my dating life. 

Not to mention, the argument you’re making implies that when a man is abused, it’s either “not in any way that matters” (seriously what the fuck dude?) or that he is some how less than a man because his skin isn’t knife proof.
Person A is the world's strongest man.

Person B cannot do one pull up.

Person B kicks person A is the eye.

Person A is in agony.

Person B does it again the next day.

And the next

And the next 20 days

Person B abuses person A
>If there  
>  
>no threat  
>  
>no actual harm is being done

Your view is that no woman can use their body in any way that threatens or causes actual harm to any man?

Also, even if we recognize that men have more strength, on average, than women, those bell curves certainly overlap. Or is your view also that there are no women who are stronger than any men? That'd be ridiculous (speaking as an adult male who knows many women who could take me down).
No one here can change your view, because the way you picture abusive relationships is not coherent with 99.999% of them.

It's never "just" physical abuse. People don't start beating their partner one day out of the blue; if that was the case, no one would be in an abusive relationship because they'd just leave immediately. The abuser always "turns the heat up slowly" so to speak. In the vast majority of cases, physical abuse is preceded by repeated psychological abuse and controlling behavior. The abuser creates a situation where their victim becomes dependant upon the relationship (emotionally, socially, economically, professionally), and will have to endure the slow increase of violence.

It doesn't matter if you're stronger than them, because by the time they first hit you, they'll have you believing that you will NEVER be able to live without them: if you leave them or if they leave you, your life is OVER. 

In most cases, you are absolutely incapable of fighting back because they've manipulated you into putting them on the highest of pedestals. They could have convinced you to abandon your friends, your family, your job, just because they're supposedly worth so much more than that. And when you value someone so much that you bear their continuous psychological and verbal abuse, in a lot of cases, a punch in the face is not going to tip the balance. You love this person too much to lay a single hand on them. So you're just gonna accept it, like you've been accepting everything else, and soon enough you spend your days getting yelled at, insulted, isolated and beaten.

Again, this should not "change your view", because you've approached this with a misconception of how abusive relationships work. But hopefully, you'll see now why women are perfectly capable of beating someone much stronger than they are, and going unpunished.
>	It is not like there’s a threat of “Oh she’s gonna kill me if I leave” there.

What?! Why wouldn’t there be? Women kill too, you know.
