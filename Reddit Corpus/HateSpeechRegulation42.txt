Funny, this came up in my feed directly after this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/houjrc/facebook_used_extensively_to_spread_neonazi_music
Did you hear that Reddit?  You don't need to wait 4+ years!  You don't need to give them plenty of advance warning so they can set up shop and leave in an orderly fashion!  You can just kick them out and everything will be fine.
Doesn't Telegram pride/promote itself based on its end-to-end encryption and that not even telegram can read the messages. Seems suspect to have both that kind of encryption and the ability to identify racism
In this day and age, why hate so much? Hate comes from ignorance.

Thanks for the responses. Really liked reading the comments.
yall who are out here spewing vitriol back and forth are really not making a productive use of your time. this is a cool thing and helps curb recruitment efforts of not only white supremacist groups, but religious extremist groups as well! shouldn’t that satisfy everyone? how is this bad?how are you all so angry? how is it so easy for people to dig their heels into the mud and refuse to budge? talk to one another, listen to one another, don’t do recruitment for extremist groups! i don’t know how half of y’all live if you’re that angry all the time you’re gonna have a rage-induced aneurysm good grief
