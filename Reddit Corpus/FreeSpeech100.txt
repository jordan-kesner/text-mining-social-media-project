Fuck off with this crap.  Violating the terms of service is not "censorship" it is because you're such assholes you refuse to follow the very few rules.
These companies are the online public square. They are censoring speech in the new public square.

It has to stop
The internet is not a public square. It is not the government's role to stop private companies from choosing what content they allow on their own websites.
Yup, Chapotrapouse are just anti-SJW progressive.

Also, Google has been purging YouTube channels that host historic speeches for educational purposes because “meh Nazis” 

It’s sad that I have to use Tor, not for NSFW reasons, for researching the Nazis and Soviets because that’s what my focus in history is....
