Title: CMV: Comparing Modern Political Movements to the Nazis is Intellectually Lazy and Dishonest 

Post:
I’m a bit of a free speech purist. I don’t want to get lost in the weeds of that for the purposes of this post, but to put it in a nutshell (and there is more nuance to this than I’m getting into here), I believe that as long as your words are not being used to physically harm someone or defraud others, they should be allowed—not only by governments, but by businesses and higher educational institutions as well.


Whenever I make this argument, however, someone inevitably says, “Well, what about Nazis? Do you support their right to free speech too?”

Another thing I hear a lot is people who compare Trump to Hitler or the Proud Boys to the Brownshirts, or, on the right, people will compare abortion to the Holocaust or Reddit mods to the Gestapo. 

All of this is disingenuous and it’s done because people don’t want to engage with ideas that are uncomfortable for them. It’s not just lazy, however, it’s also really offensive to the people who were actual victims of the Nazis. 

I think it bears pointing out what the actual Nazis did. They invaded all of their neighbors, imposed a brutal occupation, and systematically exterminated people they deemed to be subhuman—horrific, ghastly crimes.

My view is that we should not invoke their memory when discussing modern politics for this reason. Let me explain in more detail. 



**1. Nazis Don’t Really Exist Anymore**

The Nazis existed at a specific time in a specific place. The conditions that led to their rise (a rising power facing a humiliating loss after a bitter world war) were very particular. I understand that there are people who openly espouse Nazism today, but they are marginal in the extreme. Moreover, the few Nazis that do exist don’t even really understand what they’re talking about. And that’s because…



**2. Nazism Was About Aggression Against Other Countries**

The alpha and omega of Hitler’s ideology was the notion that the Germans deserved a *Lebensraum* that would come at the expense of Slavs in the east.

Without this, you don’t really have Nazism. And if Hitler had not embarked on wars of conquest, there would have been no Holocaust, as the vast majority of the victims of the Holocaust were killed in countries that Germany invaded. Hitler, without WWII, becomes Franco—not a good guy for sure, but not a name synonymous with genocide.

This is why it’s ridiculous to compare MAGA, the AfD in Germany, or Le Pen in France or any of the modern far right movements in the west to Nazis. 

To be clear, these groups are bigoted and deserve condemnation, but none of them are calling for the invasion of their neighbors. In fact, for the most part, they’re calling for the opposite—for their native lands to disengage from the world stage. 

Again, that’s not to say they’re good, just that it’s absurd to compare them to Nazis since they do not espouse an aggressive foreign policy which is what Naziism was all about and which is what made it such a horrific ideology.



It would be much more effective and intellectually honest and less offensive to the people who suffered the horrific acts of the Nazi regime, if we could simply discredit the modern far right without bringing Hitler into the discussion. 



However…some countries in the world have invaded their neighbors, right? So…

**3. But What About Countries that Do Have Aggressive Foreign Policies?**

Here’s a fun riddle: What does Russia have in common with Ukraine, and what do the leaders of Israel have in common with Hamas?

Answer: All of them get compared to Nazis!

I’ll explain why this is ludicrous, one by one:



**a. Russia:** Putin meets many of the “modern Hitler” criteria. He’s an authoritarian leader who invades his neighbors, right? Quacking like the proverbial duck. However, there are two points to make here.

First, I don’t think he wants to genocide the population of Ukraine out of existence and replace them with Russian settlers (which is what Hitler wanted to do only with Germans). What he wants is for Ukraine to bend the knee and become loyal subjects once again. And that’s not OK! But it’s also not Nazism.

Second, his army sucks. If Hitler’s army had been like Putin’s, WWII wouldn’t have happened. After 2.5 years of fighting, they haven’t been able to take one major Ukrainian city, something the Wehrmacht did within hours of invading Soviet Ukraine. Ability matters. 



**b. Ukraine:** What’s funny is that Putin claims the reason he invaded Ukraine was to rid it of Nazism. What’s even funnier is that there are actually streets and monuments in Ukraine dedicated to Stepan Bandera and the Ukrainian Partisan Army, who did temporarily cooperate with the real Nazis during WWII (before they started fighting them) and who were absolutely violent far-right antisemites. However…

Ukraine is currently led by a Jewish person and is the victim of an invasion by their neighbors, not the perpetrator of aggressive wars so… no, not Nazis.



**c. Israel:** OK, let’s get the obvious out of the way up front. Israel is a Jewish state. How could it be Nazi?

 Well, yeah, but the whole idea of Israel is a bit *Lebensraum*-y, and they do invade their neighbors and have killed thousands of innocent Palestinians, so… could they be just a little bit Nazi?

No. Because clearly, they are not fighting and killing at full force. If Israel were run by a Hitler, the area around Israel would be a howling wasteland and the Palestinians would have ceased to exist around 1948. 

Sorry, I’m not a big supporter of Israel, but I can’t say they deserve to be compared to Nazis.



**d. Hamas:** Here is a group that meets a lot of Nazi criteria. Antisemitic? Check. Genocidal? Check. Capable of inflicting devastating violence and occupation on its neighbors?

Nope. Hamas has no real weapons, no navy, no air force, no tank divisions. Maybe they’d like to be as scary as Hitler, but they just aren’t. In fact, they’re really just pathetic and weak which is the opposite of what the Nazis were. 



At the end of the day, calling someone or some country a "Nazi" is just a scare tactic. It’s used to rile people up and make them immediately hate the person or group being labeled. When we use the word “Nazi” today, it’s usually just a way to shut down any real conversation about the issues at hand. It’s all about finding a way to not have a conversation. 

And that is lazy. There are plenty of arguments one can make in favor of a liberal immigration policy or women’s reproductive rights, or police reform without resorting to labeling your opponents, “Nazis”

Or maybe I’m wrong. Is there a reason to invoke the memory of the Nazis when discussing modern politics? Am I missing something? Can you change my view?

I think part of the problem is that you're really only accepting "nazi" as the height of their power. 

The nazis were a thing well before the war started and they were already bad. When the nazis put on the Olympics there was a lot of discussion about it. There were people who already knew the nazis were bad, and there were folks who were sure it would mellow out. 

If it only counts once they've gone all out, well, sure.
It didn’t start with people in camps and gas chambers.  

It started with rhetoric they dehumanized them. 

It didn’t start with invading Poland.   

It started with blaming other countries for their problems.  

If you don’t call out the dangerous rhetoric when it’s only dangerous rhetoric then it will be too late when the atrocities happen.
> The alpha and omega of Hitler’s ideology was the notion that the Germans deserved a *Lebensraum* that would come at the expense of Slavs in the east.

Lebensraum was an application of Hitler’s central ideological principle, not the principle itself.

Before anything else, Hitler believed that the history of humanity was a history of racial struggle. To Hitler, the conflict between races was the driving engine of history, like class conflict was to Marx. All human systems, relationships, and institutions only mattered or had value based on their impact on the racial body. Races were engaged in a constant struggle for domination — stronger races expanded, while weaker ones declined. (In this, you can also see how decades of social darwinist ideas also penetrated his thinking.)

In order for a race to survive, then, it had to expand. Hitler’s focus on conquering Eastern Europe stemmed from his underlying race-based worldview. If you read Mein Kampf or especially his second, unpublished book, which is entirely about foreign policy, this is very clear. “Lebensraum” didn’t inherently refer to a particular territory; it quite literally meant space for the propagation of the Aryan race. The fact that such space existed in Eastern Europe was entirely due to the geopolitical situation of Europe at the time. 

All of this is to say, you can have Nazism without wanting to conquer Eastern Europe. Heck, you can have Nazism without wanting to conquer any additional territory. What’s fundamental is an ideology that equates the national political community with a single racial community and uses membership in that community as the sole qualification for membership. It also must believe in a perpetual state of racial *conflict*, and argue that any actions taken to advance the race’s interest are justified.

As to whether any current political movements or governments qualify under that definition, your mileage may vary. But making a comparison isn’t inherently illegitimate.
Let's take a minute here and think about what you just said. 

Left wingers say that the Proud Boys, a group who organise violent public protests where they do such things as hold tiki torches while shouting "blood and soil", literally throw up roman salutes and use Nazi flags, are like the brownshirts.

And right wingers say reddit mods are like the gestapo.

Let's consider these two statements carefully and pick which one is more accurate.
while , in general, I agree with you that vague comparisons to nazis are not helpful and lazy

I think some specific comparisons can be helpful.

For example, I think some people often talk about violent nongovernment militias as a means of preserving liberty, rather than as a threat to it, in the US.  People point to the 2nd amendment as a means of preserving liberty.  And it can be.  But, Hitler and Mussolini came to power in part utilizing violent armed nongovernment militias.

Claiming that a militia are "modern nazis" is a perhaps lazy and inaccurate comparison.  But, claiming that a violent nongovernment militia can be part of the path to power of an autocrat (not unlike Hitler's use of his militia to intimidate the legislature into passing his enabling act) is an accurate and sometimes relevant comparison.
Nazism was about far more than having "an aggressive foreign policy."  Years before the first annexation of foreign lands it had infiltrated and then destroyed German democracy and was actively scapegoating and persecuting Jews.  Years before that it was holding mass rallies of hate and intimidating opponents with violence and threats of violence.  Yes,  likening anything someone dislikes or disapproves of as "Nazism" can cheapen the memory of the actual victims of the Nazis and so care must be taken.  But if modern political movements start displaying some of the characteristics of the worst political movement in the last 100 years it's not only fair but necessary to ring the alarm bells.
When someone says "X is like the Nazis", they don't mean X is behaving exactly like the Nazis, they mean X share similarities with the Nazis, and that is sufficient to condemn them. The political context which Nazism emerged can no longer be replicated, so there will never be a political movement that is behaving exactly like the them, but since their destruction was so massive, anything that remotely resembles Nazism, either the bigotry, or aggression, or both, should be condemned and confronted at the earliest instance.
Aren't there nazis now? They call themselves nazis. Do you disagree that the nazis who call themselves nazis are nazis?
>First, I don’t think he wants to genocide the population of Ukraine out of existence and replace them with Russian settlers (which is what Hitler wanted to do only with Germans). What he wants is for Ukraine to bend the knee and become loyal subjects once again. And that’s not OK! But it’s also not Nazism.   

I think this is the biggest issue with your argument: the notion that "Nazis" only existed from 1941 to 1945.   

Believe it or not, it wasn't the intention of the Nazis for most of their reign to genocide Jewish people. For years their goal was to make life so bad in Germany that Jews would leave freely. For a while they looked into forced deportation.   

It's not until the final years of the Nazi regime that they turned to genocide.    

So essentially, when you say "I don't think Putin wants to genocide Ukranians so any comparisons to the Nazis should not be made", you're saying that we should erase the 1920 to 1940 history of the Nazis and we can only ever think about Nazis in the context of 1941-1945 Nazis.    

First off, this is an extremely reductive way of viewing history. You're saying that we can't ever take a nuanced look at history.  

Secondly, it's also dangerous: what if, just hypothetically, an *actual literal Nazi* tries to get into power in some country somewhere in the world. They act *exactly* like the Nazis did in the 1920s, exactly like the Nazis did in the 1930s, ...

According to you, despite this hypothetical literal Nazi saying the exact same things as the Nazis for 2 straight decades, imposing the exact same racial purity laws as the Nazis once in power, we still can't compare him to the Nazis because "well he hasn't genocided Jews yet".   

Don't you see how stupid this is? If we extend this argument further then we can never warn people before a genocide happens. After all, if they haven't genocided anyone, how can we accuse them of wanting genocide?   

Usually we should strive to learn from history. What you're saying is that we can't ever compare anything to history unless it's **literally exactly the same**. That's dumb
