I love my house. 110 years old, and made of stone. Suck it, wolves!

But some of the plumbing here - what the fuck? It seems like every shut-off valve in the basement is stuck. Then when I crank on it, the stem leaks. So then I have to shut off the water, drain a bunch of nearby water, pull the valve stem and drain the remaining water that did not drain previously, take the stem apart, scrape out the old packing material, and re-pack the valve stem. Reassemble the valve and pray it works. 

So far I'm on my second re-packing, and I had to full-on replace another valve.
Welp, this is certainly an interested Weekend GD Thread.  Anyway, something special for our weekly recipe that falls back to my love of cuisine, and more specifically the Creole and Cajun neck of the woods.  

Under most circumstances I know y'all are used to me posting up with Chinese inspired or just outright Chinese dishes; however, being born in the American South, raised there...and having a lot of connections with the coastal regions + an avid fan of a certain risque street and event that happens down in New Orleans, well, I might have picked up a thing-a-two.  So this week, I'm a teach y'all how to smoke a whole gator. 

Recipe of the Week:

Whole Smoked Alligator, prepared with Cajun Garlic Butter Sauce.

Ingredients:

For the Alligator:

1.  You'll want 1. Whole DRESSED alligator depending on your crowd you can get various different weights. These typically range from 6lbs for your little ones and up to 30lbs + for larger gators.  If you need more than 30lbs, I hope you're feeding a whole get together.  Right now creolefood has a 10% off deal for shipping 8 to 12 lbs of gator (whole and dressed) 175$.  and 200$ for a 12 to 20lb gator.  There are other shippers out there, but make sure to carefully vet your butcher, before trusting a shipment.  For me personally, when I want gator, I'm spoiled for local butchers, hunters, game wardens, who will kill and process the gators for me. Several of my local butchers will almost always display the tail for sale.


2.  You're going to want about 1/4 of a cup of a "cajun seasoning mix".  My personal mix for this is:  

3 tablespoons smoked paprika

2 tablespoons fine kosher salt

2 tablespoons garlic powder

1 tablespoon ground black pepper

1 tablespoon ground white pepper

1 tablespoons onion powder

1 tablespoon dried oregano

1 tablespoon cayenne

1/2 tablespoon dried thyme

1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest.

3.  A barbecue sauce of your choice, for anything between 8-15 lbs, you're gonna want about a full bottle of it, if not a full bottle. Anything over, you're going to want two bottles on hand.

For the Butter Sauce (which I use)

2 sticks butter divided

8 cloves garlic minced or grated

1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice

4 tablespoons of our Cajun seasoning from above.

Directions to make the sauce:  Toss your butter in a pan, melt it over low heat and let it cook for a minute, mix everything else in and let it cook for five minutes while whisking.

4.  You'll need to brine your gator:

Brine:

1 large cooler

At least 1 gallon water

1 1/2 cups sea salt

1 cup of sugar

4 tbsp black peppercorns

4 bay leaves

rind of two oranges.

For the fun part:  Smoking the gator.

Step 1:  Combine all the ingredients in a pot and place it over low heat until all ingredients have dissolved into the liquid. Place your gator into your cooler, then cover your gator with your brine. Allow it to soak overnight.

Step 2:  Remove your gator from the brine. I highly suggest doing this, I'm not listing anything because there are so many great options. Stuff your gator's cavity with onions, peppers, fruits, boudain, cream cheese, find something that works for you, then sew the cavity shut.

Step 3:  Using a first layer of your cajun butter mix, rub the entire gator down with it, then apply an extra layer of your cajun seasoning rub.

Step 4. Get your smoker to around 250 degrees.  If you're using wood, Pecan or Hickory is the way to go.  Once you've added your gator to the smoker, mist it every 30 minutes.

Step 5. Apply a new coat of your butter sauce every hour.

Step 6:  Depending on the size of your gator, cooking can take anywhere from 4 to 6 hours, or longer for much larger gators. Whatever size you get, monitor your gator closely!  DO NOT LET IT REGISTER ABOVE 150-152 DEGREES INTERNALLY.  It is a surprisingly delicate meat and you want to pull it out right in that range to get it up to about 155 internal.  Once it hits that range, pull it out and let it rest under foil for 5 to 10 minutes.

Step 7: You can pull the gator apart from here as if it was chicken or pork.  You can also carve off larger chunks.  Alligator is a very tender, very juicy cut of meat, the tail is the king here, but different sections will have their own flavor complexities, from the ribs, to the thighs, to "breast" to the tail itself.  

If anyone wants to experiment with it, I would highly recommend it, just be aware, it's going to be a pricy experiment, and you may want to start with an Alligator Filet before you go with the whole beast.
I'm always intrigued by where certain catch phrases come from? 

Like who is the social media manager/handler/think tank that came up with "woke mind virus"?
Little heavy for the weekend discussion but I gotta say it’s impeccable timing for Politico to try and launder Lauren Boebert as a serious politician who’s trying be more than MAGA the same day it comes out that she got kicked out of theater for disruptive behavior which included fondling/getting fondled.

**What is a lie?**

[Websters](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lie) defines a lie as

* : to make an untrue statement with intent to deceive

[Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/lie) defines a lie as

* a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth.

Over and over the term lie is defined in a manner in which there has to be intent to deceive.  Yet in my experience so many people have began attaching the term lie or liar when people are simply wrong.

In my opinion it coincides with, what I believe, to be a recent trend to exaggerate and vilify people one may not agree with.  

Being wrong doesn't come with the added moral connotations. Everyone is wrong on occasion. But a liar is seeing as crossing a moral boundary.  

Anyway I find it fascinating how often people misuse the term, especially on social media. 

Why do you think people are so intent to call others liars when they have no proof of the accused purposefully misleading others?

**Edit** it fascinates me how big of a discussion something this simple can become
Oof, that's no fun!  I renovated my old house when it was 65 years old.  The under slab galvanized had been long-abandoned and replaced with a maze of galvanized in the joists and wherever.  Redid it in copper and it looked amazing.  Also redid all the cast iron drains with PVC.  All new plumbing from the meter to the sewer cleanout just outside the house.  Then right before Covid, the main sewer connection failed and I dug and laid a new sewer line to another connection.  That was the best hot shower I ever had!

What are you work with, galvanized?  I hate the stuff.  I'd recommend buying some PEX crimp ring tools and NPT male and female adapters and replacing valves or sections as needed.  Just be sure to bond a copper wire to both ends of the galvanized!!! Lots of old houses use the plumbing for grounding and it can be a shocking experience if you dont bond them.
Had my annual  gator feast yesterday.  Chased it with an Andy Gator for good measure.  TN still lost.  After 15+ years of eating gator on this date it should work by now.
