Title: Should there be more regulation and controls on social media?

Post:
There is a call by public figures for more government control of social media outlets.

In a recent CNN interview, the discussion focused on the growing calls for more regulation of social media companies. Lawmakers and experts highlighted the need for tighter oversight to address issues like misinformation, privacy concerns, and the platforms' role in amplifying harmful content. They pointed to the influence of these companies on public opinion, elections, and mental health, especially among younger users. Proposals for regulation include stronger data privacy laws, increased transparency around algorithms, and measures to combat the spread of disinformation. The interview also touched on the challenge of balancing regulation with free speech and innovation, as well as the global nature of these platforms, making regulation complex. Social media executives, in response, have expressed openness to working with governments but emphasize the need for careful, well-considered regulation that doesn’t stifle their platforms' ability to operate effectively.

Privacy concerns? Sure, absolutely. But I think once you get into the 'misinformation' category you start to creep into censorship. And I'm not a fan of that personally.
Yes, but we don't need a system that tries to police misinformation. 

We need systems that help people identify it on their own. 

As an idea, imagine if there was a government SSO for social media. You create an account and verify it to something like SSN or other federal or state ID.

You don't need to create this account, but if you do then any social media platforms you use it on has a special, identifying mark that cannot be replicated any other way on those sites.

So if you choose to use a non-verified, email only account everything stays the same, but there is an obvious difference of who's willing to put their money where their mouth is.

That's mostly orientated at helping reduce foreign influence on social media, but it could see some other uses.
Who decides what is misinformation? That's a slippery slope that leads to censorship and the 1984 crap we see going on in the UK/Canada.
We definitely need to outlaw TikTok. Free speech was written to protect American protesters protesting the American government, not China's well-resourced propaganda arm poisoning young minds by way of cellphone apps.

  
All around, free speech absolutism needs to be re-evaluated. Its tendency to elevate Trump-types (who then threaten free speech anyway) has demonstrated it to be self-defeating. But outlawing TikTok is the most urgent part of that.
Oversight to control misinformation is 100% opposite to privacy concerns. The left always likes to pretend to care about privacy but at the end want all of us under watch.
People have the right to say and post whatever they want within legal boundaries (no threats, cp, etc). When it comes to mis/disinformation, as annoying as it is, it's up to the individual to follow up on that information. "Getting your info from Facebook" has been a thing and a joke for years but no one cared until the democratic party felt they may lose this cycle. When the Republican party was screaming about mis/dis info during the last election no one cared or believed them and unfortunately a lot of it turned out to be accurate. 
If someone wants to believe whatever they see or read on the Internet without looking into it, that's on them. Id like to think the majority of the country has at least some critical thinking skills despite what reddit reflects lol
The same groups spreading misinformation are framing it as a free speech issue.  I think the way to break this problem down is to understand the tactics being used.

Then dispassionately expose misinformation and give users a simple set of heuristics that preempt disinformation.

In the past the government would use it's own propaganda, public service announcements.  Some thing as simple as  a limerick.

I don't think it's a catch all.  But it is similar to magic in that once society understands how it works, you have to be engaging in self deception to participate in it.
I would say if a conservative is yelling about flat earth and you're in danger of believing it then it says more about you.
