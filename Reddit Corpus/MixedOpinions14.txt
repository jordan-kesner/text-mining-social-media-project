Title: CMV: Printing an image of the Muslim prophet Muhammad is not "standing up for free speech"

Post:
Context: the [tragedy at Charlie Hebdo](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30710883) on 1/7/15. Whether this attack was directly provoked by a printed image of Muhammad or not, my argument will be framed as if it were. I'll paraphrase some of my posts in other threads:

The problem I have with this is that non-Muslims came out of the blue to offend Muslims on this particular issue. There's no honor in that, we're not on any sort of moral high ground.

Consider this hypothetical: Previously, there was no issue with freedom of expression. Then Some Guy learns that many Muslims forbid printed images of their prophet. Guy says, "hey, wouldn't it be *just hilarious* if we *printed an image of their prophet*??" So Guy prints image of their prophet. Angry terrorist coward shoots and kills Guy. Guy's friends call him a martyr, cry censorship. Except there is no censorship, freedom of expression still exists 100%, Guy's publication and others can and likely will post more of these images in the future. 

If a group of people is encroaching upon your rights or beliefs then by all means defend yourself as appropriate. And as I understand it, many Muslim factions are indeed doing that around Europe and there is no insignificant amount of tension. But in this particular instance, *we kindof started it.* We created an issue where there was none.

Freedom of expression does not imply freedom from consequences. SHOULD murder be the consequence? *Absolutely not.* However, what *should be* in this world and *what are* are two completely different things; so, we fight battles to turn the "what ares" into the "should bes." Is the battle to print images of Muhammad, among human trafficking and rape and all the other issues, really one we need to be fighting, really worth losing lives over? I guess for some, maybe. I wonder how that policeman and his family feel about it. 

So now, we created a situation where 1) we defend freedom of speech at high cost and continue to print things like this, or 2) we censor ourselves and the turrists win. It's a situation born of childishness that has now ended in tragedy and left us with a difficult path forward. The "point" that now exists to be made did not exist before our initial and unprovoked challenge to Muslim beliefs. And in the name of what, *satire*? 


**EDIT: I appreciate all the responses, a handful of you have given some great discussion. However I'm getting mired and confused in trying to keep up with and remain thoughtful in my responses, so I am taking a break to reflect and collect. I will come back and answer those I have missed. Thanks again, back in a little while.**

It's not governments that people are "standing up" to.  It's the people who would *like* to see these things criminalized (the same people who are killing people for it).  No one is under the impression that the US or French governments are engaged in censorship.  Both countries are fortunate and appreciative of the protection they have with regard to expression.

In play, however, is a group of people who would very much like to see that censorship introduced.  This demonstration of saying "We're going to do what we want" is not aimed at governments, but at those people. 

This did not begin because someone was intentionally raising ire by publishing these cartoons in a mocking way, at least not any more than any other political cartoon is drawn.  People did not just start fights to be antagonizing, any more than you see people throwing bacon at Jews just because they don't approve of its consumption.

What happened here is more analogous to the following:

Someone in a cafe is having a bacon sandwich, and a Jew comes up to them and starts screaming about how bacon is forbidden in their culture, and starts threatening to kill their families if they don't stop eating that bacon.  So everyone else in the cafe ordered a bacon sandwich, too.
"The "point" that now exists to be made did not exist before our initial and unprovoked challenge to Muslim beliefs."

Do you really believe that? I am genuinely concerned if you think this is how it started?
The basis of free speech is allowing those with different opinions than you being allowed to say and draw what they want. It is about respecting those who disagree with you to have the write to "speech" what they wish. Freedom of speech is meant to protect people from being hurt or killed because they express their beliefs. 

In this case these people are expressing the belief that they do not like that Muslims want to enforce their beliefs on others. That not only can they not create an image of Muhammad but nobody can do that. 

Could we respect their wishes and not make images of Muhammad? Sure. Might even be a good idea because like you say it's not a good fight. But at the same time if we truly believe in freedom of speech then people should have the write to make an image of Muhammad. Even if it's simply to say I can do this because I don't respect your beliefs. 

And if we don't call it freedom of speech then where do we draw the line? What if 50 years from now President Bush VII's followers decide that you should not say negative things about his intelligence. And they kill you if you do. Would it be wrong to say negative things about his intelligence? Do you simply stop doing that to please his followers?
And where does your appeasement actually stop? Does it stop at stoning Muslim women in a western democracy? Or does it stop at applying Sharia law to non-Muslims? Do you have a line at all, or will you always rely on the the justification "we kinda started it"?

All you have to do to stand up for something is do it with the intention of doing so in order to stand up for the principle. What that means is, there are douchey ways to stand up for principles and non-douchey ways. Standing up for gun rights by going out and getting your concealed carry permit is not douchey. Standing up for gun rights by posting a youtube video of you shooting a bunch of cardboard cutouts of sandy hook kids is douchey. Both were standing up for rights it's just that guy #1 was saying "I have rights damnit and I will express them." and guy #2 was saying "Haha I have rights watch me do this stupid thing with them." 
>Freedom of expression does not imply freedom from consequences. SHOULD murder be the consequence? Absolutely not. However..

That's why you should change your view.

I'm not sure that sentence should ever be followed by a "however".
Other commenters have said really good things, but I want to add one point. The leagues of people who are now coming out with their own muhammed cartoons have two messages.

First, they are standing up to the extremists and essentially saying: "you can not scare us, you can not stop us, we will not back down." No amount of violence is going to make this right go away.

Second (and more importantly in my opinion), people are saying to others in the west that we will stand with them if they want to continue their satire. And it is working (so far)- look at two past examples of the way states/media covered the issues. Salman Rushdie had a fatwa calling for his death after the Satanic Verses was published, and in 2006 the Danish cartoons caused a massive worldwide pogrom. In both cases governments, religious leaders, and the media responded by:

1) not showing the cartoons (or pulling the book)
2) condemning the art/artist.

Rosa Parks was arrested for sitting at the front of the bus, even though it offended plenty of people. You can bet your ass that had I been there at that time, I would have been at the front of the bus the next day. 
I feel like I need say no more or less than this: you're argument is like that which blames a woman for being raped because she wore sexually appealing clothes. They started nothing and ought to say and print whatever the publication deems permissible. Victim bashing is reprehensible. 
I would suggest you reframe and concisely restate your view. I'm not site what's being argued, but what I think would change your view is to study the history of extremists protesting depictions of Muhammad (Salmon Rushdie, Danish cartoon several years ago, etc.). This is considered a real and serious threat to freedom of expression, and in my view a justification to print provocative material regarding Muhammad.

You are using the "you shouldn't have provoked the bully" defense when the Islamists are unrepentant bullies regarding free speech. Fuck them.

Edit: Is the shooting itself not a vindication of the publishing these cartoons as an act against those who wish to limit speech?
