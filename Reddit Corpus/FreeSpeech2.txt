Title: Kamala Harris has stated she will use the Justice Department to come after people for exercising their Free Speech

Post:
"We will hold social media platforms accountable for the hate infiltrating their platforms because they have a responsibility to help fight against this threat to our democracy,”..."I won't toletate it"

Harris said that, if elected, she would “double” the resources at the Justice Department’s civil rights division as well.

“If you profit off of hate, if you act as a megaphone for misinformation or cyber warfare, if you don’t police your platforms, we are going to hold you accountable,” Harris said.

I’m constantly amazed to meet people who are terrified that if we don’t defeat Trump, we’ll lose our free speech and the justice system will be weaponized against political opponents. Uh… have you been paying attention?
You should understand that the candidates are already captured by the major tech companies. Harris saying that she’s going to use the Justice Department to go after hate speech is a message fully vetted by the major players, and that can only mean that the government will use the DoJ to stifle competition.
Then she will likely be impeached almost immediately (?)

This is the commie shit that is poison to America and which needs to be vomitted out.

On hopes a huge number of democrats see this is not anything they believe in and either dont vote for this commie or vote for Trump to counter the votes for her.
