Title: Enough debates! Just go get it already.

Post:
Enough debating!  Just go out and get it already!  It protects you, your family, and everyone in the community.  It's been scientifically, mathematically, and statistically proven to make everyone safer.  The communities that got them are overwhelmingly safer.  The chance of side effects or accidents are so unbelievably small that it is absurd to not get one already.

Quit being selfish, stop arguing online, and go out and buy a firearm.

I read somewhere that guns can cause infertility and can make you magnetic.  I am waiting a year or two to see how it goes before I get one.
