Title: Did most Trump voters not believe he is a threat to democracy or did they not care?

Post:
Democracy was on the ballot in America's election. [Both](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/30/nx-s1-5170908/harris-argues-that-trump-poses-a-threat-to-democracy-in-the-final-days-of-the-race) [candidates](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-goes-dark-maga-and-calls-harris-threat-to-democracy/) argued that the other candidate was a threat to democracy. But experts agree that Trump is a [clear threat](https://www.gov.harvard.edu/2024/10/31/steven-levitsky-daniel-ziblatt-publish-op-ed-in-nyt/) to American democracy, not Harris or the Democrats. Why? In his first term, he tried to [overturn](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c93pdlg4dlno) the 2020 election that all [evidence](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118) shows he lost. During his first term he also used the powers of the federal government improperly to [go after](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/amazon-claims-trump-blocked-10-billion-defense-contract-because-he-hates-jeff-bezos?srsltid=AfmBOorN76UwttQ_nXMj2DSE9TEa17Jk8XYRudocru8rk1VbrxCXIO2e) his opponents and to try to [sway](https://www.newsweek.com/irs-feared-trump-stimulus-checks-broke-law-1972140) voters. In his campaigning, he has repeatedly praised strongmen like [Putin ](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/23/trump-putin-ukraine-invasion-00010923)and Orban and said he wants to emulate them. He has threatened to [punish](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/trump-election-opponents-threats) his opponents and to stay in office [past](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/18/trump-at-nra-convention-floats-a-three-term-presidency-00158786) a second term. 

So why did the Trump threat to democracy not affect Trump voters?

Do most Trump voters just not care about democracy all that much? Data from [exit polls](https://apnews.com/article/democracy-harris-trump-threats-authoritarianism-election-2024-56b4eb981f34f3e60aec1e45a67fc8a2) suggests that many voters for both Trump and Harris said their vote choice was motivated strongly by appeals to defend democracy. This was the number one reason for most Harris voters, but it was also the first or second most important reason cited for many Trump voters. Surveys also suggest [similar](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/48238-most-americans-support-democracy-and-oppose-dictatorship) levels of support for democracy among Democrats and Republicans. However, it is possible that Trump voters are not as committed to democracy even if they say it matters to them in surveys.

Another possibility is that Trump and Harris supporters just think democracy means different things, and Trump's actions are consistent with how Trump supporters think about democracy. Social science research suggests Republicans and Democrats understand democracy to mean [the same thing](https://theconversation.com/how-different-people-around-the-world-understand-democracy-and-why-it-matters-241617): free and fair elections and political freedoms like free speech. But maybe when you drill down into the details, Trump supporters have different ideas about what makes an election free and fair or which freedoms should be defended.

It could also be the case that Trump convinced his supporters he is the one defending democracy. If they believe the election in 2020 really was stolen from him, that Democrats are letting immigrants vote for them illegally, and that Trump's prosecutions were political retribution, they might accept the narrative that Trump was persecuted by a corrupt and authoritarian Democratic party. But maybe these beliefs are not deeply held and are just claims made to justify their political project, for which democracy doesn't matter all that much. 

Is there another possibility I am missing? 

I realize these different explanations will apply to some Trump voters and not others, but what do you think is the most important explanation?

Many voters’ priorities may align with Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, where basic physiological and safety needs—such as food, housing, and financial stability—take precedence over abstract concepts like democracy. 

With high inflation eroding purchasing power and 70% of people believing the country is on the wrong track, it’s possible that concerns about day-to-day issues outweighed broader political fears. 

This doesn’t necessarily mean voters didn’t see a threat to democracy but rather that their immediate needs overshadowed long-term considerations.
I think “Trump voter” is too broad of a category. You have the core MAGA voters who think Trump walks on water and then you have people who decided to vote for Trump over Harris. 

We all know how the MAGA voters feel. But I suspect many of the other Trump voters simply don’t pay that much attention to media on either side. I don’t think they were swayed by either side so much as they didn’t pay attention.
They didn’t believe it. Because most of us already saw a Trump term and look democracy is still here. That’s the logic anyway
I don't think people generally consider democracy as a net positive as an abstract concept. They like it when it sees them as the winner and consider losing the end of civilization. Social media has exacerbated this.
I think the answer is most either didn't understand or don't think it's realistic.


Given most people don't really have a deep philosophical understanding of politics upwards of 50% of voters (of both parties) probably see the furore over Jan 6 etc as not especially significant.


Of the rest, I think there is a compelling argument to be made that the US system is robust enough that democracy will survive. Indeed, this is my belief and also explains why there is not a sudden exodus from the US to say Europe following the election.
I must ask, if Biden himself believes all this, what was going on with the "welcome back" and their cosy fireside chat and photoshoot from the other day? What does that communicate to voters in regards to the notion that democracy itself was on the ballot?
he's not a threat to democracy. 

additionally, with how  hypocritical many democrats were (attempting to remove people from the ballot, forcing biden out via threats in back rooms after he won the nomination, harris being installed as the nominee by party elites, various elected democrats saying they wouldn't commit to certifying the election if trump won), the entire "threat to democracy" claim came across even more hollow than it  would have normally been. it's just like when they called him a fascist and it had no impact because they used the same spiel with romney, mccain, bush2, and pretty much every well known republican over the last 20-30 years.

if someone wants to claim their opponent is a threat to democracy, maybe  they shouldn't blatantly disregard democracy themselves.
Based on what I've seen, Trump voters didn't believe he is a threat to democracy, but in a peculiar way: by totally dismissing real, concrete indications, statements and historical events that underline the threat to democracy Trump has shown himself to be. 

The common thread among the hardcore trump followers seem to be an outright rejection of reality, replacing it with the soundbites and lines they are fed by the trump campaign and his spokesmen, however hollow they are. 

There was, of course, no serious indication that Harris would be any kind of threat to democracy, at least the common interpretation of the term. Still, it was repeated and seemingly believed by hordes of trump followers, probably feeding a sense of urgency and importance.

As a foreigner not used to the seemingly airtight information silos the american populist right wing news industry causes, this kind of total rejection of reality in favor of a manufactured, false substitute seems absurd, especially as a minimum of critical thinking would surely be enough to break the illusion. I am, however, aware of the same happening all over the western world.

Viewed from Northern Europe, a trump victory – including the planned effects on rule of law, international power dynamics, US military hegemony and a long history of liberal values, looks like the worst case outcome of an environment where reality can be substituted with whatever the messenger hoping for power wishes for. The effects will surely be disastrous, so I hope for some degree of mitigation by the american legal system and institutions, even though this presidency is designed to minimize outside influence, not only during the presidential period but in the future as well.
Trump has convinced his base that democracy is really only about him. 

If he loses, democracy is over because it is stolen. If he wins, democracy is saved because he is president. He was talking about fraud constantly before the election but now? Crickets.

The ONLY reason we're having a peaceful transfer of power now is because he won. He and his allies were planning round 2 of attempting to overthrow the vote and/or violence if he lost.

Then you have the Harris voters who saw his threat and voted against him.

And then you have the rest who don't pay much attention and just want things to be cheaper. 

Meanwhile his cabinet is a who's who of people who will target his perceived enemies and weaken our democratic institutions.
