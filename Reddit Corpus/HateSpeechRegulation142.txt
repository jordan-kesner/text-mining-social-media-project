Title: How to be anonymous social media content creator?

Post:
I live in a place where I can't talk freely without being arrested for some topics like religion and politics where they are legal in other places, but we don't have free of speech in my country, so I want to be able to make content about these kinds of things and be as private as possible.

Are there any approaches that should I use in order to achieve that where I can post content on Instagram, Reddit and YouTube anonymously?

\- No real names

\- Always use a VPN

\- If you publish photo and or video content make sure itÂ´s not traceable. This means: no identifiying background like streets, print products, consumer products that are local. For increased security: Use Meta-data remover as all photos and videos can be traced back using meta-data. 

\- You can use voice filters to distort / change your voice or even use an AI voice which could be even more untraceable
\- Creative username

\- Use VPN

\- Cover your face, wear a mask to identify 

\- Use tools to tweak your voice 

\- Tell no one the truth
That's a brave step! Use tools like VPNs and anonymized accounts, and avoid sharing personal details or metadata in your content. Platforms like Reddit can be a great start for anonymous discussions while staying safe.
A lot of Faceless YT channels exist with excellent scriptwriting in place, read by AI and accompanied by animation from AI, including the use of source materials. I'm sure there must be discussions in this forum that go in to detail.
