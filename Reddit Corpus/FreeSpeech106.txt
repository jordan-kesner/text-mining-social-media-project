Title: The Free Speech Distraction: misinformation/disinformation, anti-Semitic/Neo-Nazi sympathies, "cancel culture" and "liberal media bias" as scapegoats under the guise of "protecting free speech" (... _for whom_ is the real question).

Post:
To challenge my assumptions, I reviewed the top posts on the homepage here before completing the following paragraphs. The top-posts review is also included below.

The original idea for this post was that when bigots, harassers, stalkers and abusive people want to evade criticism, they tend to use a common evasive tactic.

For example:

- the fight by non-white/women/LGBT people for equality is reframed as "wokeism"/"cancel culture" (i.e. persecution against cisgender/heterosexual white males, and cis/het men generally) -- therefore a "free speech issue".

- when white supremacists want to dodge the fact that they use social media to radicalise new recruits and plot white-terrorist attacks like January 6th's attack on the American capitol buliding, they hide behind the notion that their "free speech" is under attack.

- any move to hold ex-President Donald Trump accountable is reframed as an attack by "the mainstream media" or "the deep state" against Trump (to persecute and be terribly mean to him), rather than _prosecute_ the crimes that he and his administrations/cronies committed, often in broad daylight, while in office and since then.

- sympathy with violent Neo-Nazism is reframed as merely "differing opinions" and therefore protected as "free speech" -- even though Nazism exists for no other purpose than genocide.

The more "moderate" commentors, when it's noted that they only speak for the "free speech" rights of already-privileged cisgender/heterosexual white males, again retreat to "on both sides" or "all lives matter"-style arguments. These arguments are essentially hand-waving, as if further protecting the "free speech" status quo for cis/het white males will somehow lead to a better world for everyone. This is a laughable notion which, as whisleblower Fraces Haugen has made clear from Facebook's own internal documents, is [blatantly, egregiously and violently false](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/10/25/facebook-papers-whistleblower-hate-speech-black-americans-trump-floyd/6156418001/), especially regarding "free speech" on social media.

So I looked at the top posts here today, and this is what I found:

- conspiracy theories (specifically, misinformation about COVID-19)
- overgeneralisations as mentioned above ("on both sides", anti-Semitism/coddling of white supremacism, etc.).
- right-wing sympathising, including two instances of direct cross-posting here from r-TheTrumpZone. Several instances conflating strong disagreement with right-wing views, as "censorship" against those views.
- absolutely no direct mention of issues that mention the protection of free speech for anyone who isn't white, male, cisgender and heterosexual -- the demographics who inarguably face the most pressing and deadly forms of misinformation/disinformation/oppression around the world.

A key element of unconscious bias is that you're unable to see it yourself, but the posts and comments here speak for themselves, as listed below. If you think the listing is "biased", add your specific interpretations to the specific item(s) in the comments below. Be specific.

Overgeneralisations about how "everyone" is to blame for America's current situation. Ultimately, a typical "on both sides" argument.

- [The BMJ to Facebook—Stop Censoring Us and Shut Down Your Incompetent Fact-Checkers](https://np.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/rk2jih/the_american_political_system_is_so_disgusting/)

Site conflates the British Medical Journal's problems with its own issues. The site itself (trailsitenews dot com), however, prominently lists several articles that are blatant misinformation about COVID-19 on its homepage, such as [this one](https://trialsitenews.com/the-costs-of-inoculating-children-against-covid-19-far-outweigh-the-benefits/), [this one](https://trialsitenews.com/the-original-antigenic-sin-covid-19-vaccination-and-sub-optimal-initial-immune-priming-deranges-the-antibody-cytotoxic-t-cell-immune-response/), and [this one](https://trialsitenews.com/dont-vaccinate-kids-urgent-message-from-doctors-summit/) (and [this one](https://trialsitenews.com/for-the-public-record-critical-questions-fda-must-address-about-vaccine-safety/))

Comments section is flooded by conservatives complaining about how they are the "real" victims, completely ignoring the post itself, and often conflating criticism of right-wing beliefs with "censorship".

The post is itself an overgeneralisation about "shutting up" "everyone". The actual problem is that (some) "leftists" intensely dislike J.K. Rowling's persistent transphobia.

Comments section flooded by predictable [transphobia](https://np.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/rjdazu/leftists_who_hate_j_k_rowling_whats_wrong_with/) and complaining about ["wokeism"](https://np.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/rjdazu/leftists_who_hate_j_k_rowling_whats_wrong_with/hp3pzdl/). The one person who [points out the obvious](https://np.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/rjdazu/leftists_who_hate_j_k_rowling_whats_wrong_with/hp6hfm9/) (harassment of celebrities is a universal problem, not specific to J.K. Rowling or "leftists") is the downvoted until it is no longer visible. 

(The deeper issue is that transphobia is not seen as a violently dehumanising ideology.)

Yes, Youtube censors content that advances misinformation regarding COVID-19. McCullough advances essentially every form of deadly misinformation possible and [now faces the loss of his medical licence for doing so](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-08-16/doctors-coronavirus-misinformation-license).

- [German government plans to ban Telegram because protesters use it to organize](https://www.dw.com/en/covid-protests-escalate-in-germany/a-60118647)

The article makes no mention of banning Telegram. It does mention this small bit of context, however:

> In Germany, this reminds many of the beginnings of Nazi terror on the streets in the 1930s. And it raises concern with those who remember the deadly shooting of politician Walter Lübcke, of the center-right Christian Democrats,  in front of his own home in 2019 by a right-wing extremist.

The comments section delves deep into hard questions (such as "when will liberals realise they're the _real_ bad guys?"), though it seems clear that very few commenters bothered to actually read the article at all. Only one comment of the thirty-three mentioned the fact that [Telegram seems to be violating German law against incitement and violence in public spaces](https://np.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/rialc2/german_government_plans_to_ban_telegram_because/hox0vn3/) (see also: [source link on tagesschau dot com, in German](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/gewalt-corona-proteste-103.html)).

Interesting comment regarding childrens' (lack of) free speech [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/rhsyan/freedom_of_speech_untill_it_matters_a_protest/host08k/), followed by typical false equivalence and "just asking question" distraction tactics about "BLM" [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/rhsyan/freedom_of_speech_untill_it_matters_a_protest/hosubvw/) as well as "gun violence and climate change" [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/rhsyan/freedom_of_speech_untill_it_matters_a_protest/hosy1nh/).

It seems that the MP was ordered to delet the posts [due to violation of Dutch law](https://np.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/rhlrjc/dutch_mp_ordered_to_delete_covid_holocaust_social/hosl48o/) against [their anti-Semitic nature](https://np.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/rhlrjc/dutch_mp_ordered_to_delete_covid_holocaust_social/hosr97r/) as detrimental to Dutch Jewish people as members of the larger Dutch society.

Top Comments:
Eh, you lost my interest when you tried to claim JK is transphobic. That just tells me you’re a Leftist who only repeats what other people say without looking into the issue yourself. She’s not transphobic, and has never said anything transphobic. She’s only ever spoken out about the erasure of womens identity by calling pregnant women “birthing people” and other alt-left extreme crap.

Even from your first paragraph it was immediately obvious you’re one of those people where everything you disagree with is an -ist, -phobe, nazi, or fascist. Your entire essay reads like someone trapped in a bubble who only sees and perceives things the way you wish them to be. Meanwhile you project onto others what you yourself are guilty of but refuse to acknowledge because you’re on the “right” side of history.
I could write an essay in reply, but it's not worth my time, so I will focus on one of your claims: "the fight by non-white/women/LGBT people for equality is reframed as 'wokeism'/'cancel culture' (i.e. persecution against cisgender/heterosexual white males, and cis/het men generally) -- therefore a 'free speech issue.'" That's false. Wokeism has nothing to do with the fight for equality. It is, in fact, just the opposite. Wokeism is ignorant racist elitists trying to hurt and crush the disadvantaged while giving the powerful even more power. Hence, "defund the police" as long as only poorer, mostly minority communities are being victimized by the predictable increase in murder and mayhem from idiotically demonizing police and coddling criminals, but "refund the police" as soon as the violence infiltrates wealthy, mostly white communities. Wokeism is ignorant and racist elitists claiming that some of the best human qualities--prized and demonstrated by people of all races--are "white supremacist" qualities. Much of the woke dogma is largely indistinguishable from KKK dogma. I call wokeism "white supremacism masquerading as anti-white racism" and I think that is a very accurate description of this sick, anti-American ideology.
Good read. Probably won't be popular on here for the reasons you cited. I'm so cynical about this sub, I wanted to send the "First time?" meme while reading this.
This is just how it always has been. The ones in power try to push their agenda through any means necessary, and the opposition needs free speech to be a thing in order to stay alive.
> The irony of this post regarding biases....

The irony of /u/choobad responding about "irony" to a post that already contains a mention of the comment about "biases" someone was so obviously going to make without bothering to read the post first...
So, /u/Silentcrypt, apparently to you I'm "one of those people where everything I disagree with is an -ist"...

...and yet, barely two sentences into your comment, you somehow label me as a "Leftist [blah blah blah]".

And the rest of your little two-paragraph "anti-woke" rant just digs deeper into its own little buzzword-filled, copy-pasted, predictably scripted "outrage" about "projection" and "alt-left extremism" and whatever else you felt like shoveling in.

And, unfortunately for your silly attempt at painting me as a "leftist" (my response: who cares) because I actually pay attention to the voices of people who are not cis/het white males --- yes, JK Rowling has been a ["gender-critical"](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/12/19/21029874/jk-rowling-transgender-tweet-terf) transphobe [for a long time](https://www.vogue.com/article/jk-rowling-transphobic-tweets). It's not a matter of debate for anyone who isn't still desperately contorting themselves trying to defend her transphobia for some reason or other.
