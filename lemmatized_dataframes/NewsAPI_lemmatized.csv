interested deal essentially look tariff instrument see kind know willingness look deal even area right mean probably doug going talking security front especially far ukraine concerned know sense know want deal necessarily interested actually fine detail deal long deal right seems kind impression economics front economics front perhaps little sort footnote especially security know think drive deal put european difficult predicament almost regardless happens scenario indeed let say deal ukraine actually reached firstly presumably reached head european course kind know brings sort issue problem deal actually potentially politically divisive europe insofar presumably country particularly north eastern europe see pretty bad deal therefore really require continuing support ukraine term defense term threat force mean going doug going essentially know deal fragile therefore require sort committed european response situation actually think relatively divisive europe country willing see know peace made right therefore opportunity back term support ukraine course scenario deal probably even plausible first scenario sort trump actually kind get bored start looking nobel peace prize elsewhere scenario ongoing war deal onto shoulder european anyway onto second aspect old know steroid indeed protectionism know know going tariff steel aluminum quite know exactly extent sense subset broader tariff europe think basically two model mean considering tariff already announced hand sense china model hand mexico canada model mean think far course know percent tariff already seems part
